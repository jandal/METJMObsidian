 

## Approaching the Inn

As the party makes their way through Phandalin's modest streets, read or paraphrase:

> The Stonehill Inn stands as one of Phandalin's newer and more welcoming buildings. Its foundation of fieldstone gives way to a timber upper storey, with warm light spilling from its windows even in the afternoon. A painted sign depicting a stone atop a grassy hill sways gently above the entrance. The sounds of conversation and clinking tankards drift out whenever the door opens.
> 
> As you approach, you notice the building is well-maintained, with flower boxes beneath the windows and a swept entrance—a marked contrast to some of the more ramshackle buildings you've passed.

## Entering the Inn

> Pushing open the heavy wooden door, you're greeted by a wave of warmth and the mingled scents of woodsmoke, ale, and roasting meat. The common room is modest but clean, with several tables occupied by townsfolk and travellers alike. A large fieldstone fireplace dominates one wall, its cheerful fire taking the edge off the evening chill.
> 
> Behind the bar, a short, friendly-looking human male with sandy hair and an easy smile looks up from the tankard he's polishing. "Welcome to the Stonehill Inn, travellers! Come in, come in! I'm Toblen Stonehill, proprietor of this establishment. You look like you could use a hot meal and a cold drink!"

## The Common Room

The inn's patrons represent a cross-section of Phandalin life:

- **A handful of local miners** sit at one table, their clothes still dusty from the day's work
- **A well-dressed human woman** (Trilena, Toblen's wife) moves between tables, serving food
- **A young halfling boy** (Pip, their son) enthusiastically buses tables while sneaking glances at the adventurers
- **Several other townsfolk** enjoy their evening meal

## Initial Interaction with Toblen

> Toblen gestures to an empty table near the fireplace. "Please, sit wherever you like. First round's discounted for new faces in town—we don't get many visitors these days, what with the troubles on the roads."

**Toblen's Offerings:**

- **Lodging:** 5 sp per night for a modest room (sleeps two)
- **Meals:** 3 sp for a hearty meal (roasted meat, vegetables, bread, and cheese)
- **Ale:** 4 cp per tankard (locally brewed, "Nothing fancy, but it's honest")
- **Wine:** 2 sp per pitcher (imported from Neverwinter)

### If Barthen sent them:

> "Ah, Elmar sent you, did he? Good man, Barthen. In that case, your first meal's on the house. Any friend of his is welcome here."

## Gathering Information

As the party settles in, various opportunities for information gathering present themselves. Toblen is happy to chat while serving:

### From Toblen Stonehill

**About the Inn:**

- "Built this place myself two years ago when we moved from Triboar. Figured Phandalin needed a proper inn, what with all the rebuilding going on."
- "We try to keep things peaceful here. No trouble, no fights. There are... other places in town for that sort of thing."

**About the Town:**

- "Phandalin's growing, slowly but surely. Good soil for farming, and there's still gold in the hills for those willing to work for it."
- "Most folk here are decent, hardworking people. We look out for each other, or at least we try to."

**About the Redbrands (spoken quietly):**

- "Keep your voice down about that lot. They've got ears everywhere."
- "Bunch of ruffians who moved in a few months back. They hang about the Sleeping Giant tap house, causing trouble."
- "Their leader calls himself Glasstaff. Never seen him myself, but they say he's some sort of wizard."
- "They leave us alone mostly, but... well, they 'collect taxes' from some of the businesses. And folks who speak out against them have a habit of... leaving town sudden-like."

**About Recent Events:**

- "You're not the first to have goblin trouble. The creatures have grown bold as brass lately."
- "Sister Garaele at the Shrine of Luck returned from a trip a few days ago looking haggard. Won't say what happened, but something scared her good."
- "Daran Edermath—he's got the orchard on the edge of town—he's been asking around for folks who can handle themselves in a fight."

### From Trilena (if approached)

Toblen's wife is pleasant but more reserved than her husband:

- "Don't mind the Redbrands too much if you keep your head down. They're mostly interested in gold and ale."
- "Poor Thel Dendrar spoke out against them. Haven't seen him or his family in over a week now. Their house stands empty."
- "Qelline Alderleaf's boy Carp claims he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but you know how children are with their stories."

### From Pip (if the party seems friendly)

The young halfling boy, about 10 years old, is fascinated by the adventurers:

> The boy sidles up to your table, eyes wide. "Are you real adventurers? Do you fight monsters? I bet you've seen all sorts of amazing things!"

If encouraged:

- "My friend Carp—he's Ms. Alderleaf's son—he said he saw some Redbrands coming out of a secret tunnel in the woods! He was going to show me, but his ma found out and gave him such a talking to!"
- "There's a scary old tower on the hill. Sometimes at night, you can see strange lights up there. Pa says it's just tricks of the moon, but I know better!"

## Potential Encounters

### 1. Narth, the Gossipy Farmer

> A weather-beaten farmer at the bar notices the newcomers and ambles over, ale in hand. "New faces! Welcome to Phandalin, friends. Name's Narth. Don't suppose you're looking for work? Plenty of folks around here could use help from capable sorts like yourselves."

Narth knows:

- "Sister Garaele's been looking poorly since she returned from Conyberry way. Might need some help, if you're the helping type."
- "Daran Edermath's been asking after sellswords. Something about trouble at Old Owl Well."
- "The townmaster's put up a notice about orcs near Wyvern Tor. Hundred gold pieces reward, if you can believe it!"

### 2. Lanar, the Disgruntled Miner

> A grizzled miner sits alone, nursing his drink and muttering. If approached, he looks up with bloodshot eyes. "You're not with them Redbrands, are you? No? Then maybe you can help where others won't."

If pressed:

- "My friend Thel stood up to those bastards when they were hassling his wife. Now his whole family's gone—'left town' the Redbrands say, but Thel would never leave without saying goodbye."
- "They've got the whole town scared. Even the townmaster won't do nothing about it."

### 3. Elsa, the Barmaid (evening only)

A young human woman who helps during busy hours:

- Whispers: "If you're thinking of standing up to the Redbrands, be careful. They've got a wizard leading them, and hideout somewhere under the old manor."
- "Halia Thornton at the Miner's Exchange seems to know more about them than she lets on, if you ask me."

## Evening Entertainment

If the party stays into the evening:

> As night falls, the common room fills with more locals. A travelling minstrel produces a lute and begins playing traditional songs. The atmosphere is warm and friendly, though you notice people still speak in hushed tones when certain topics arise, and more than one patron glances nervously at the door when it opens.

## Retiring for the Night

When the party decides to rest:

> Toblen shows you to your rooms up the wooden stairs. "Breakfast is included with the room—nothing fancy, but it'll fill your bellies. And friends... a word of advice? If you're planning to stay in Phandalin a while, be careful who you cross. Not everyone in town wishes newcomers well."
> 
> The rooms are simple but clean, with comfortable beds, wash basins, and shuttered windows overlooking the street. After your trials on the road, it feels like luxury.

## Morning After

If the party stays overnight:

> You wake to the sound of activity in the street below and the smell of bacon and fresh bread wafting up from the common room. Sunlight streams through your window, and for a moment, you can almost forget the dangers that brought you to this frontier town.
> 
> Downstairs, Trilena serves a hearty breakfast while Toblen greets you warmly. "Sleep well? Good, good. So, what are your plans for the day? If you're looking to help around town, I'd start with Sister Garaele or Daran Edermath. Both could use assistance from capable folks."
