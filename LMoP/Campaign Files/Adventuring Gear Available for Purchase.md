## Recommendations by Character

### Dusty Crab (60 gp available)
**Priority Purchases**:
1. **Healer's Kit** (4 gp 5 sp) - Already has 10! Dusty is well-stocked
2. **Component Pouch** (22 gp 5 sp) - Backup for arcane focus if lost/stolen
3. **Chalk** (9 cp for 10 pieces) - Mark explored dungeon areas
4. **String/Rope backup** - Consider silk rope (9 gp) for lighter weight

**Nice to Have**:
- **Crowbar** (1 gp 8 sp) - Useful for the whole party
- **Additional rations** - Supplement the party's food supply
- **Ink and parchment** - Record spell research and journey notes

**Budget After Essentials**: ~35 gp remaining for potions or magic items

---

### The Duke (20 gp available - LIMITED BUDGET)
**Priority Purchases**:
1. **Healer's Kit** (4 gp 5 sp) - Essential for stabilising downed allies
2. **Tinderbox** (4 sp 5 cp) - Already has one in Explorer's Pack, skip
3. **Chalk** (9 cp for 10 pieces) - Mark paths
4. **Crowbar** (1 gp 8 sp) - Advantage on Str checks, perfect for barbarian
5. **Extra rations** (4 sp 5 cp each) - Stock up for 5 days = 2 gp 2 sp 5 cp

**Critical Need**:
- **Ranged weapons** (see weapons guide) - Priority over gear

**Budget Suggestion**: Save 10-15 gp for javelins/weapons, spend 5-10 gp on utility gear

---

### Xanorin (85 gp available)
**Priority Purchases**:
1. **Healer's Kit** (4 gp 5 sp) - Essential for adventuring
2. **Herbalism Kit** - Check tools guide (Xanorin might want this for creating potions)
3. **Climber's Kit** (22 gp 5 sp) - Excellent for druid exploring wild areas
4. **Ball Bearings** (9 sp) - Crowd control, synergises with battlefield control spells
5. **Caltrops** (9 sp per bag) - Buy 2-3 bags for area denial
6. **Silk Rope** (9 gp) - Lighter than hemp, ideal for druid

**Nice to Have**:
- **Antitoxin** (45 gp) - Expensive but valuable for poison resistance
- **Holy Water** (22 gp 5 sp) - Effective against undead
- **Lantern, Hooded** (4 gp 5 sp) - Better light control than torches
- **Manacles** (1 gp 8 sp) - Capture enemies alive for interrogation

**Wild Shape Consideration**: As a Circle of the Moon druid, Xanorin spends significant time in beast form, so focus on items usable in humanoid form or useful for the whole party.

**Budget After Essentials**: ~40-50 gp for weapons and consumables

---

### Zurkt (Gold unknown)
**Priority Purchases**:
1. **Healer's Kit** (4 gp 5 sp) - Paladin can stabilise and use Lay on Hands
2. **Holy Water** (22 gp 5 sp per flask) - Buy 2-3 flasks for fighting undead/fiends
3. **Crowbar** (1 gp 8 sp) - Useful for forcing doors

- **Silver for Holy Water creation** - 25 gp worth of powdered silver per flask
- **Climber's Kit** (22 gp 5 sp) - If budget allows

**Note**: Zurkt already has a Priest's Pack with basic supplies. Focus on combat consumables and holy items that synergise with Oath of Vengeance.

---

## Party-Wide Recommendations

### Critical Gaps to Fill
1. **Healing Supplies**: Only Dusty has healer's kits (10!). Others should buy at least one each
2. **Light Sources**: Party relies on torches. Consider lanterns for better light and duration
3. **Exploration Tools**: Chalk, rope, grappling hooks for dungeon delving
4. **Holy Water**: Essential for undead encounters (Zurkt and potentially others)

### Shared Resources Strategy
Consider pooling gold for expensive shared items:
- **Climber's Kit** (22 gp 5 sp) - One for the party
- **Portable Ram** (3 gp 6 sp) - Duke or Zurkt can carry
- **Hunting Traps** (4 gp 5 sp each) - Set ambushes

### Budget-Friendly Essentials (Under 10 gp total)
- Chalk (9 cp × 10 = 9 cp)
- Ball Bearings (9 sp)
- Caltrops (9 sp per bag)
- Crowbar (1 gp 8 sp)
- Healer's Kit (4 gp 5 sp)
- **Total: ~8 gp** for excellent utility

---

| Acid | 22 gp 5 sp | Anyone | MEDIUM |
| Antitoxin | 45 gp | Everyone | MEDIUM |

---

---

## Special Notes

### Creating Holy Water
Zurkt (or any cleric/paladin) can create Holy Water:
- **Requirements**: 1 hour ritual, 25 gp powdered silver, 1st-level spell slot
- **Result**: 1 flask of Holy Water (normally 25 gp value)
- **Benefit**: Break even on cost, useful for party

### Healer's Kit Usage
- **10 uses per kit**
- **Stabilise dying creature** (0 HP) without Medicine check
- **Action to use**
- **Critical for party survival** - everyone should carry one

### Light Source Comparison
| Source | Duration | Range | Cost |
|--------|----------|-------|------|
| Torch | 1 hour | 20ft bright/20ft dim | 9 cp |
| Lamp | 6 hours | 15ft bright/30ft dim | 4 sp 5 cp + oil |
| Hooded Lantern | 6 hours | 30ft bright/30ft dim | 4 gp 5 sp + oil |
| Bullseye Lantern | 6 hours | 60ft cone bright/60ft dim | 9 gp + oil |

**Oil Cost**: 9 cp per flask (6 hours of light)

---

## Weight Considerations

With limited carrying capacity, prioritise:
1. **Light, essential items**: Chalk, string, healer's kits
2. **High utility-to-weight**: Crowbar (5 lb but very useful)
3. **Avoid heavy items** unless critical: Sledgehammer (10 lb), Portable Ram (35 lb)

**The Duke** and **Zurkt** have high Strength - they should carry heavy shared items like climbing equipment, ram, or extra rope.

---

## Selling Old Equipment

Lionshield Coster buys equipment at **50% of list price**:
- Unwanted weapons or armour
- Duplicate items
- Heavy items you're not using

Consider selling before buying to maximise available gold.
