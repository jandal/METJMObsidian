## Basic Mechanics

|**Duration**|1 minute (10 rounds of combat)|
|**Usages Per Day**|Level 1-2: 2 rages<br>Level 3-5: 3 rages<br>Level 6-11: 4 rages<br>Level 12-16: 5 rages<br>Level 17-19: 6 rages<br>Level 20: Unlimited rages|
|**Early Termination**|• If you end your turn without attacking a hostile creature since your last turn or taking damage since your last turn<br>• If you become unconscious<br>• If you choose to end it (no action required)|

## Benefits While Raging

|Benefit|Description|
|---|---|

|**Damage Resistance**|Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage|
|**Strength Advantage**|Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws|

## Limitations While Raging

|Limitation|Description|
|---|---|
|**Armour Restrictions**|Cannot rage while wearing heavy armour|
|**Attack Restrictions**|Damage bonus only applies to melee attacks using Strength (not Dexterity or ranged attacks)|
|**Spellcasting**|Cannot cast or concentrate on spells|
|**Maintenance Requirement**|Must either attack a hostile creature or take damage each round to maintain rage|

## Specific Combat Uses

### Starting Rage

```
On The Duke's turn:
1. Use bonus action to rage
2. Movement (if desired)
3. Attack action (should use a Strength-based melee attack to get rage damage bonus)
```

### Maintaining Rage

```
Each round after rage begins:
1. Either attack a hostile creature OR take damage before end of turn
2. If neither occurs, rage ends at the end of your turn
```

### Effective Tactics While Raging

|Tactic|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Reckless Attack**|At 2nd level, gain advantage on Strength-based melee attacks at cost of enemies having advantage against you (extra effective while raging due to damage resistance)|
|**Grappling**|Rage gives advantage on Athletics checks, making you an effective grappler|
|**Damage Sponge**|Position yourself to take hits from multiple enemies (resistance makes this effective)|
|**Strength Checks**|Use Strength for environmental interaction (breaking doors, lifting portcullises) while raging for advantage|

## Rage Enhancement Path

|Level|Additional Rage Features|
|---|---|
|2|Reckless Attack, Danger Sense|
|3|Primal Path choice (subclass)|
|5|Extra Attack, Fast Movement|
|7+|Path features + Feral Instinct, etc.|

## When to Rage

### Optimal Scenarios

- Combat expected to last multiple rounds
- Facing multiple opponents
- When taking heavy physical damage is likely
- When Strength-based challenges are imminent

### When to Save Your Rages

- Very brief/easy encounters
- Primarily magical opponents (damage resistance less useful)
- When you might need rages for later encounters
- When stealth or social skills are more important than combat

## Roleplay Considerations

Rage isn't just a mechanical ability—it's a core thematic element of barbarians. Consider these roleplay aspects:

- What triggers your character's rage? (Specific threats, protecting others, etc.)
- How does your rage manifest? (Cold fury, berserk frenzy, trance-like state)
- What physical signs show when you're raging? (Bulging veins, glowing eyes, shouting)
- How does your character feel after raging? (Energized, exhausted, ashamed)

A barbarian's rage can be an excellent storytelling tool that defines your character's personality and development.
