# Darkvision Guide for Lost Mine of Phandelver

## Party Darkvision Status

|Character|Race|Class|Darkvision|Range|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Xanorin|Lightfoot Halfling|Druid|No|-|Can Wild Shape into beasts with darkvision|
|Dusty Crab|Dragonborn|Sorcerer|No|-|Can potentially learn Darkvision spell|
|Zurkt|Thunder Goblin|Paladin|Yes|60 ft.|Special lightning enhancement|

## Xanorin's Wild Shape Options with Darkvision

As a 2nd-level druid, Xanorin can transform into beasts with a CR of 1/4 or lower that don't have flying or swimming speeds. Several of these forms have darkvision:

|Beast|CR|Darkvision Range|Other Senses|Special Abilities|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Wolf|1/4|60 ft.|Keen Hearing and Smell|Pack Tactics|
|Panther|1/4|60 ft.|Keen Smell|Pounce, excellent Stealth|
|Giant Badger|1/4|30 ft.|Keen Smell|Multiattack, burrow 10 ft.|
|Giant Rat|1/4|60 ft.|Keen Smell|Pack Tactics|
|Giant Weasel|1/4|60 ft.|Keen Hearing and Smell|Good Stealth skill|
|Spider|0|30 ft.|-|Spider Climb, good Stealth|
|Rat|0|30 ft.|Keen Smell|Tiny size for infiltration|

These Wild Shape options give Xanorin excellent scouting capabilities in darkness, particularly the Wolf or Panther forms which combine darkvision with good movement speed and useful combat abilities.

## Zurkt's Lightning-Enhanced Darkvision

**Thunder Goblin Racial Feature: Lightning Sight**

Whenever lightning energy is present within 30 feet of Zurkt, his natural darkvision is temporarily enhanced:

- Range increases from 60 feet to 120 feet
- Duration: 30 seconds (5 rounds of combat)
- This enhancement represents Zurkt's Thunder Goblin heritage allowing him to harness the "all-seeing power of lightning"
- Visual Effect: Zurkt's eyes crackle with tiny lightning arcs when this ability is active

**Triggering Methods:**

1. **Lightning Spells:** Any spell with lightning damage cast within 30 feet
2. **Tempestuous Magic:** When Dusty Crab uses their Storm Sorcery feature "Tempestuous Magic" to fly 10 feet after casting a spell (the small storm created contains enough electrical energy to trigger Zurkt's ability)
3. **Environmental Lightning:** Natural lightning strikes during storms
4. **Magical Items:** Any item that produces lightning effects

## Light Sources & Alternatives

Since most of your party lacks darkvision, they'll need alternative light sources:

|Light Source|Brightness|Duration|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Torch|Bright 20 ft, Dim 20 ft more|1 hour|Requires one hand to hold|
|Lantern (Hooded)|Bright 30 ft, Dim 30 ft more|6 hours (1 flask of oil)|Can be closed to hide light|
|Light Cantrip|Bright 20 ft, Dim 20 ft more|1 hour (concentration)|Can be cast on an object|
|Continual Flame (spell)|Bright 20 ft, Dim 20 ft more|Permanent|Requires 50gp ruby dust|

## Darkvision Considerations in Lost Mine of Phandelver

### Cragmaw Hideout

- Areas 3-8 are dark unless stated otherwise
- Goblin inhabitants have darkvision (60 ft)
- Zurkt will be the only party member able to see naturally
- Narrow passages make torchlight tactically problematic

### Redbrand Hideout

- Underground complex is dark throughout
- Human bandits will be using light sources
- Secret areas may require careful investigation in low light

### Wave Echo Cave

- Entirely dark unless noted
- Various monsters with darkvision inhabit the cave
- Large open spaces where light sources reveal party position
- Some water areas where torches may be impractical

## Tactical Considerations

### Advantages of Darkness

- Characters without darkvision can hide effectively in total darkness
- Sneaking past enemies with darkvision may require extinguishing lights
- Zurkt can scout ahead safely but may need to relay information

### Disadvantages of Light Sources

- Reveals party position to creatures with darkvision from much greater distances
- Requires a free hand (unless using Light cantrip on equipment)
- May prevent surprise in stealth situations

### Spells to Consider

- **Light** (cantrip): Available to several classes
- **Dancing Lights** (cantrip): Multiple light sources, controllable
- **Darkvision** (2nd level): Grants darkvision 60 ft for 8 hours
- **Continual Flame** (2nd level): Permanent light source (requires costly material)

## Lightning Spells for Activating Zurkt's Enhancement

|Spell|Level|Class|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shocking Grasp|Cantrip|Sorcerer|Melee spell attack, advantage vs. metal armor|
|Witch Bolt|1st|Sorcerer|Sustained damage, concentration required|
|Lightning Bolt|3rd|Sorcerer|100 ft line, 8d6 damage (acquired at higher levels)|
|Call Lightning|3rd|Druid|Sustained lightning strikes, outdoor advantage|

## Custom Rulings to Consider

1. **Partial Light**: Creatures in areas of dim light have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight
2. **Surprise in Darkness**: Creatures without darkvision have disadvantage on initiative rolls in darkness if combat begins unexpectedly
3. **Ranged Attacks**: Consider imposing disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond the range of a character's darkvision or light source
4. **Environmental Lightning**: Natural lightning strikes during storms could potentially trigger Zurkt's enhancement
5. **Lightning Traps**: Consider placing lightning-based traps that might inadvertently benefit Zurkt
