# Difficult Terrain in D&D 5e

## Basic Rules

Difficult terrain represents challenging landscapes and environments that impede movement. It's a fundamental tactical element that adds depth to combat encounters and exploration.

|Core Rule|Description|
|---|---|
|**Movement Cost**|Each foot of movement through difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot (effectively halving speed)|
|**Diagonal Movement**|Still counts as 5 feet for the first diagonal, 10 feet for the second (if using that optional rule)|
|**Jumping**|Difficult terrain affects the run-up to a jump, potentially reducing jump distance|
|**Multiple Sources**|If an area is covered by multiple sources of difficult terrain, you only apply the effect once|

## Common Types of Difficult Terrain

|Natural|Urban|Magical/Special|
|---|---|---|
|Dense forest|Rubble|Magical effects (e.g., Entangle spell)|
|Thick underbrush|Cluttered rooms|Webs (natural or magical)|
|Deep snow|Stairways|Areas affected by Spike Growth|
|Ice|Construction sites|Certain oozes and slimes|
|Mud or swampland|Crowds|Desecrated ground|
|Rocky terrain|Barricades|Antimagic fields (for some creatures)|
|Shallow water|Broken structures|Ethereal turbulence|
|Mountain scree|Tangled cables/chains|Areas of reversed gravity|

## Effects on Gameplay

- **Tactical Movement**: Forces players to consider their movement carefully
- **Positioning**: May prevent characters from reaching certain positions in a single turn
- **Action Economy**: Can require using the Dash action to overcome
- **Defensive Strategy**: Can be used to slow enemy advances
- **Range Considerations**: Affects how quickly characters can close to melee range

## Circumventing Difficult Terrain

|Method|How It Works|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Flying**|Flight bypasses ground-based difficult terrain|Some magical difficult terrain might still affect flying creatures|
|**Teleportation**|Teleportation effects ignore the intervening space|Includes spells like Misty Step, Dimension Door|
|**Woodland Stride**|Druids (2nd level) ignore difficult terrain from plants|Class feature, limited to natural growth|
|**Step of the Wind**|Monks can spend ki to ignore difficult terrain for one turn|Part of their mobility focus|
|**Freedom of Movement**|This spell allows normal movement through difficult terrain|4th-level spell that lasts 1 hour|
|**Swimming**|In water, swimming speed replaces walking speed|Creatures with swimming speeds ignore difficult terrain in water|
|**Magic Items**|Boots of Striding and Springing, etc.|Various items can help mitigate effects|

## DM Considerations

### Narrating Difficult Terrain

When describing difficult terrain, be specific about what makes movement challenging:

- "The ankle-deep mud sucks at your boots with each step"
- "Broken furniture and debris are scattered everywhere, forcing you to carefully pick your way through"
- "Thick, thorny vines snake across the forest floor, grabbing at your ankles"

### Using Difficult Terrain Effectively

- **Create Choices**: Position difficult terrain to create meaningful tactical decisions
- **Protect Ranged Units**: Place difficult terrain between melee attackers and ranged units
- **Dynamic Changes**: Terrain can change during battle (collapsing structures, spreading fires)
- **Partial Coverage**: Not all of an area needs to be difficult terrain - patches and paths create interesting movement puzzles

### Tracking Difficult Terrain

- Mark difficult terrain clearly on battle maps (hatched lines, different colours)
- For Theatre of the Mind play, regularly remind players which areas contain difficult terrain
- Consider using physical markers (cotton balls for fog, pebbles for rubble) on physical maps

## Optional Rules

- **Extreme Terrain**: Some DMs use "extreme difficult terrain" that costs 3 feet of movement per foot traveled
- **Skill Challenges**: Allowing Athletics or Acrobatics checks to move normally through difficult terrain
- **Exhaustion**: Prolonged travel through difficult terrain might cause levels of exhaustion
- **Tactical Advantage**: Granting advantage on certain checks to creatures familiar with a specific type of difficult terrain
