Here's what Xanorin's network might know:

1. **Druid Circle Information:**
    
    - Reports of unnatural ecological disturbances in the region
    - Strange animal behavior patterns near certain caves
    - Concerns about potential mining operations disrupting local natural balance
    - Rumors of ancient magic stirring after centuries of dormancy
2. **Spy Network Information:**
    
    - Whispers of increased goblin activity under new leadership
    - Reports of a mysterious figure called "The Black Spider" taking interest in the area
    - Knowledge that several parties have been quietly searching for something near Phandalin
    - Awareness that the Rockseeker brothers have been researching old maps and legends

This information gives you flexibility as the DM:

- You can reveal these details if Xanorin makes appropriate checks or contacts their network
- The information is vague enough that it doesn't spoil major plot points
- It creates natural hooks for the character to be invested in the story
- It gives Xanorin special value to the party through their unique knowledge

You could have Xanorin roll an Intelligence (Investigation) check or Wisdom (Insight) check when Gundren mentions the "lost mine of immense value." Based on the roll, you might whisper to the player that their character recognizes this matches reports from their network about increased interest in the area.
