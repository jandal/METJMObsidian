## Setting the Scene

The worn wheels of Gundren's wagon creak to a halt outside a modest but well-maintained trading post. A wooden sign swings gently in the afternoon breeze: "Barthen's Provisions" painted in fading blue letters. The building appears to be one of the larger establishments in Phandalin, with wide doors designed for loading and unloading goods.

## Initial Approach

As the party approaches with the wagon, read or paraphrase:

> The doors to Barthen's Provisions stand open, revealing a well-stocked interior filled with shelves of goods, barrels, and hanging tools. The smell of leather, grain, and lamp oil wafts out into the street. A young human man emerges, wiping his hands on a canvas apron. His eyes widen with relief as he spots the wagon.
> 
> "By Tymora's luck! Is that Gundren's shipment? We've been expecting you for two days now!" He calls back into the shop, "Master Barthen! The supplies have arrived!"

## Meeting Elmar Barthen

> A lean, grey-bearded man in his fifties emerges from the shop, moving with the energy of someone half his age. His keen eyes quickly take in the party, the wagon, and—with a frown—the absence of certain expected faces.
> 
> "Welcome, welcome! I'm Elmar Barthen, proprietor of this establishment. I see you've brought Gundren's supplies, but..." his expression grows concerned, "where is Gundren? And Sildar Hallwinter? They were meant to arrive before you."

## The Conversation

### If Sildar is with the party:

Sildar steps forward, still showing signs of his ordeal. Barthen's face pales as he recognises his condition.

> "Sildar! What in the Nine Hells happened to you? Come, come inside. Ando, fetch water and bandages!" Barthen ushers everyone inside before continuing, "Please, tell me everything."

### If Sildar is not present:

Barthen's concern deepens as the party explains the ambush.

> "Goblins, you say? And they took Gundren?" He shakes his head gravely. "This is dire news indeed. Gundren was quite secretive about his reasons for coming here, but he seemed excited—more excited than I'd seen him in years."

## Unloading and Payment

> Barthen calls his two clerks—Ando and Thistle—to help unload the wagon. As they work, he continues, "Regardless of Gundren's fate, you've completed your part of the bargain. The agreed payment was ten gold pieces each, was it not?"
> 
> He produces a small leather pouch and carefully counts out the coins. "Here's your payment. You've earned it, especially if you fought through a goblin ambush."

**Payment:** Each character receives 10 gp as promised.

## Gathering Information

Barthen is happy to share what he knows while the goods are being unloaded:

### About Gundren:

- "Gundren and his brothers—Tharden and Nundro—came through here about a tenday ago. They were asking about maps of the area, particularly the hills and mountains to the east."
- "He was tight-lipped about specifics, but mentioned something about 'reclaiming our heritage' and 'the find of a lifetime.'"
- "The brothers split up—Tharden and Nundro headed east into the hills while Gundren returned to Neverwinter to gather supplies and hire help. That would be you folks, I suppose."

### About the Goblin Trouble:

- "The goblin raids have gotten worse these past few months. The Triboar Trail used to be relatively safe, but now... well, you've seen for yourselves."
- "Most of the attacks happen east of here, between Phandalin and the ruins of Conyberry."
- "If you're looking for more information about the goblins, speak with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster. Her shipments have been hit several times."

### About Phandalin:

- "You'll find most of what you need here in town. The Stonehill Inn has clean beds and decent food if you're looking to rest."
- "If you need weapons or armour, Linene at the Lionshield Coster can help, though her prices are a bit steep."
- "We're a small town, but we're growing. The old ruins are being rebuilt, and new families arrive every month."
- "Just... be careful around the Sleeping Giant tap house. It's become a rough place lately. The Redbrand ruffians have taken it over as their drinking hole."

## Barthen's Request

As the conversation winds down:

> Barthen's expression grows serious. "If you're planning to search for Gundren, I'd be grateful. He's a good customer and, more importantly, a friend. The goblin trail you mentioned—it leads northeast from the ambush site, you say?"
> 
> He pauses, then adds, "I can't offer much in the way of reward, but I'll make sure you get fair prices on any supplies you need. And if you do find Gundren... well, I suspect whatever he's discovered will make it worth your while."

## Roleplaying Elmar Barthen

**Personality:** Friendly, honest, and concerned about his community. He's a successful merchant who genuinely cares about Phandalin's growth and safety.

**Mannerisms:**

- Frequently strokes his beard when thinking
- Uses merchant's phrases like "A fair deal benefits all" and "Trust is the currency of good business"
- Keeps mental inventory of everything in his shop and can find any item quickly

**Knowledge:**

- Knows everyone in town and their general business
- Aware of the Redbrand problem but careful not to speak too openly about it
- Has heard rumours about strange happenings at the Old Owl Well and Wyvern Tor

## Potential Hooks

During the conversation, Barthen might mention:

1. **The Redbrands:** "Keep your weapons close and avoid travelling alone at night. The Redbrands have been getting bolder."
    
2. **Other Adventuring Opportunities:** "If you're looking for work while you search for Gundren, several folks in town might have jobs for capable adventurers like yourselves."
    
3. **Wave Echo Cave Legend:** If pressed about why Gundren might be kidnapped: "There are old stories about these parts—tales of a magical mine called Wave Echo Cave. But those are just legends... aren't they?"
    

## Concluding the Scene

> As you prepare to leave, Barthen adds, "Please, if you learn anything about Gundren's whereabouts, let me know immediately. And... be careful out there. Phandalin may look peaceful, but darkness gathers at its edges."
> 
> He sees you to the door, adding, "The Stonehill Inn is just up the street if you need lodging. Tell Toblen that Barthen sent you—he'll treat you right."
