# Cover Rules in D&D 5e

|Type of Cover|Mechanical Benefit|Visual Indicator|Examples|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Half Cover**|+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws|About half the creature's body is concealed|Low walls, furniture, other creatures, narrow trees|Most common form of cover in tactical combat|
|**Three-Quarters Cover**|+5 to AC and Dexterity saving throws|About three-quarters of the creature's body is concealed|Castle battlements, wide tree trunks, portcullises, arrow slits|Significant protection that can make targets very difficult to hit|
|**Total Cover**|Cannot be targeted directly by attacks or most spells|The creature is completely concealed|Complete barriers like solid walls, closed doors, being on the opposite side of a building|Spells requiring line of sight cannot target creatures behind total cover|

## Additional Cover Rules

- **Line of Sight**: Cover is determined from the attacker's perspective
- **Multiple Sources**: Use only the highest degree of cover that applies
- **Creatures as Cover**: Other creatures (allies or enemies) can provide half cover
- **Area Effects**: Cover provides protection against certain area effects that specify a Dexterity saving throw
- **Determining Cover**: Draw an imaginary line from the centre of the attacker's space to the centre of the target's space - if the line passes through any obstruction, the target has cover

## Strategic Considerations

- Ranged attackers should position to minimise enemy cover
- Spellcasters may need to reposition to target enemies behind cover
- Some spells and abilities can ignore cover (e.g., Magic Missile)
- Certain feats (like Sharpshooter) can negate the AC bonus from half and three-quarters cover
- Cover can be crucial for survival, especially for characters with lower AC and HP
