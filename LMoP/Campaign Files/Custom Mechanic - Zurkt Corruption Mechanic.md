# Zurkt's Inner Struggle
## Overview

This custom mechanic represents Zurkt's ongoing battle against his goblinoid nature. As a Thunder Goblin who has chosen the path of a paladin, he constantly faces the pull of his ancestral tendencies toward chaos and self-interest. This struggle manifests as a "Corruption Score" that can increase when Zurkt is exposed to certain triggers, and decrease as he affirms his paladin's oath and receives support from allies.

## The Corruption Score

Zurkt has a Corruption Score that ranges from 0 to 10:

- **0-3**: Firmly in control, only minor intrusive thoughts
- **4-6**: Struggling with his nature, occasional lapses in judgment
- **7-9**: Greatly compromised, goblin instincts dominate most decisions
- **10**: Temporarily fallen, goblin nature has taken full control

### Starting Corruption Score

Zurkt begins with a Corruption Score of 5, representing his precarious balance between his paladin vows and goblin nature.

## Increasing Corruption

The following events or circumstances can increase Zurkt's Corruption Score:

### Automatic Triggers (No Save)

- Witnessing allies performing dishonorable acts: +1
- Being reduced to 0 hit points: +1
- Being targeted by a charm effect (even if he saves against it): +1
- Extended time (3+ days) without performing a paladin ritual or prayer: +1

### Resistance Checks

When exposed to these triggers, Zurkt must make a Wisdom saving throw:

|Trigger|DC|Corruption Increase if Failed|
|---|---|---|
|A goblin/hobgoblin leader attempts to command him|10 + leader's CHA modifier|+1|
|Being in the presence of a goblin tribe for more than 1 hour|12|+1|
|Being mocked or rejected for his paladin ways|12|+1|
|Being offered significant material wealth or power to abandon his oath|15|+2|
|Being in the middle of goblinoid ritual or celebration|15|+2|

At levels 1-4, these saving throws are made with a straight Wisdom check. At levels 5+, Zurkt gains advantage on these saving throws as his paladin resolve strengthens.

### Dusty's Influence

When someone from a goblin tribe attempts to convince Zurkt to join them or embrace his goblin nature, they make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by Zurkt's Wisdom save. If Zurkt fails, his Corruption increases by 1.

The DC for Zurkt's saving throw equals 8 + the persuader's proficiency bonus + their Charisma modifier.

## Decreasing Corruption

Corruption can be reduced through the following means:

### Actions Zurkt Can Take

- Performing a 10-minute personal prayer ritual: -1 (once per day)
- Undertaking a significant act that upholds his paladin ideals: -1
- Refusing a significant temptation aligned with goblin values: -1
- Spending a full day in meditation at a holy site: -1d4

### Help from Allies

- **Dusty Crab's Persuasion**: As a charismatic figure, Dusty can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check after spending at least 10 minutes in conversation with Zurkt. On a success, Zurkt's Corruption is reduced by 1.
- **Group Support**: If the entire party spends a short rest encouraging Zurkt and affirming his paladin path, his Corruption is reduced by 1. This can only be done once per long rest.
- **Divine Intervention**: If the party finds a temple of a good or neutral deity, a cleric there can perform a ritual to reduce Zurkt's Corruption by 1d4.

## Effects of Corruption

### At the Table

- **Corruption 0-3**: No mechanical effects, full control of character
- **Corruption 4-6**: -1 penalty on Charisma checks when acting against goblin nature or upholding paladin ideals
- **Corruption 7-9**:
    - Disadvantage on Charisma checks when acting against goblin nature
    - After a long rest, must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom save or lose access to one paladin feature for the day (DM's choice)
    - Temptation to steal or act selfishly (DM might ask for Wisdom saves in certain situations)
- **Corruption 10**:
    - Character temporarily becomes an NPC under DM control
    - Acts according to traditional goblin values and instincts
    - Can attempt to reassert control once per day with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw

### Narrative Manifestations

Consider manifesting Zurkt's corruption level visually:

- **Low Corruption**: Eyes bright and clear, posture straight and dignified
- **Medium Corruption**: Occasional twitches, more hunched posture, eyes darting more
- **High Corruption**: Hunched posture, cackling laugh emerges spontaneously, fingers constantly fidgeting as if wanting to grab something
- **Corruption 10**: Full goblin behavior, eyes gleaming with mischief or malice, constantly eyeing others' possessions

## Redemption from Corruption 10

If Zurkt reaches Corruption 10 and becomes temporarily NPC-controlled, there are several ways he can be redeemed:

1. **Personal Willpower**: Once per day, Zurkt can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Success reduces his Corruption to 9 and returns player control.
    
2. **Dusty's Intervention**: Dusty Crab can attempt to reach Zurkt with a contested Charisma (Persuasion) check against 10 + Zurkt's current Corruption score. Success reduces Corruption to 9.
    
3. **Group Intervention**: The entire party can stage an intervention during a short rest, with each member making a different skill check (Persuasion, Intimidation, Religion, etc.) against DC 15. If at least half the party succeeds, Zurkt's Corruption drops to 9.
    
4. **Divine Cleansing**: A temple or sacred site dedicated to Zurkt's paladin ideals can perform a ritual requiring rare components worth 50gp, automatically reducing Corruption to 8.
    

## Advancement with Level

As Zurkt levels up, his resistance to corruption grows:

- **Levels 1-4**: No modifications (as described above)
- **Levels 5-8**: Advantage on all saves against increasing Corruption
- **Levels 9-12**: Can reroll one failed Corruption save per day
- **Levels 13+**: Maximum Corruption can never exceed 7 (he can never fully fall)

## Integration with Existing Mechanics

This Corruption system functions alongside existing D&D mechanics without replacing them. It's important to note:

- Divine Sense and Lay on Hands still function normally at all Corruption levels below 10
- This is not the same as the Oathbreaker mechanic and doesn't replace it
- Regular paladin progression continues regardless of Corruption level
- Corruption primarily affects roleplaying and creates interesting narrative moments

## Using This in Your Campaign

This mechanic should be a background element that occasionally comes to the foreground for dramatic moments. It's not meant to punish the player, but rather to:

1. Create meaningful character development opportunities
2. Give Dusty's high Charisma a special purpose in the party dynamic
3. Add tension to encounters with goblinoid creatures
4. Reflect Zurkt's backstory as a Haunted One in mechanical terms
5. Provide interesting roleplaying hooks for the whole party

Remember that the ultimate goal is fun and storytelling. If any aspect of this mechanic becomes frustrating rather than interesting, be ready to modify it with player input.

## Sample Scenarios

### The Goblin Recruiter

While in town, a hooded figure approaches Zurkt, revealing himself as a goblin scout for a nearby tribe. He tries to convince Zurkt that his "paladin nonsense" is just a phase, and that his true place is with his own kind. This triggers a Corruption check.

### The Battlefield Decision

After defeating a group of bandits, the party finds a substantial treasure. While the others are distracted, Zurkt has a moment where he could easily pocket some valuables without being noticed. This is a chance for him to resist temptation and potentially reduce his Corruption score.

### The Tribe's Ritual

The party needs to infiltrate a goblin settlement for a quest. For Zurkt, being surrounded by tribal goblin culture triggers several Corruption checks. Dusty might need to help keep him focused on their mission.
