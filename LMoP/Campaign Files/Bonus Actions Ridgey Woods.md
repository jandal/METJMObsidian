# Bonus Actions Available to Your Party

## Xanorin (Lightfoot Halfling Druid, Level 2)

1. **Spellcasting**: Certain druid spells can be cast as bonus actions:
    
    - **Healing Word**: Range 60 feet, heals 1d4 + Wisdom modifier hit points
    - **Shillelagh**: Transforms a club or quarterstaff into a magical weapon with improved damage
2. **Wild Shape**: At 2nd level, you can use a bonus action (instead of an action) to transform into a beast form if you've already used Wild Shape once during your turn.
    
3. **Naturally Stealthy (Racial)**: You can attempt to hide when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you. (This uses your bonus action to Hide)
    

## Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer, Level 2)

1. **Tempestuous Magic (Storm Sorcery)**: When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to fly 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
    
2. **Font of Magic - Flexible Casting**: You can use a bonus action to convert sorcery points to spell slots or vice versa.
    
3. **Spellcasting**: Certain sorcerer spells can be cast as bonus actions:
    
    - **Expeditious Retreat**: After casting, you can use a bonus action in subsequent turns to take the Dash action

## Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin, Level 1)

1. **Nimble Escape (Goblin Racial Trait)**: If Thunder Goblins retain standard goblin traits, they can [Disengage](3-Mechanics%2FCLI%2Factions#Disengage) or [[Hide]] as a bonus action.
    
2. **Two-Weapon Fighting**: If Zurkt were to use two light weapons (rather than his greataxe), he could make an off-hand attack as a bonus action.
    

## The Duke (Human Barbarian, Level 1)

1. **Rage**: Entering rage is a bonus action. This gives The Duke advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, +2 damage with Strength-based melee weapon attacks, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    
2. **Two-Weapon Fighting**: If The Duke were to use two light weapons (instead of his greataxe), he could make an off-hand attack as a bonus action.
    

## Universal Bonus Actions (Available to All Characters)

1. **Two-Weapon Fighting**: When taking the Attack action with a light melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon held in the other hand.
    
2. **Using certain magic items**: Some magic items require a bonus action to activate.
    
3. **Commanding a controlled mount**: Directing a mount to take certain actions in combat.
    
4. **Help Action**: In specific situations, characters can use their bonus action to Help an ally (though this is normally an action, some class features or circumstances may allow it as a bonus action).
    
5. **Offhand Shove or Grapple**: If a character has a feature that grants a bonus action attack (like Two-Weapon Fighting), they can sometimes replace that attack with a shove or grapple attempt, subject to DM ruling.

### Notes for Advancement

As your characters level up, they'll gain access to more bonus action options:

- **Xanorin (Druid)**:
    - More spells with bonus action casting times
    - Circle-specific features (depending on choice at level 2)
- **Dusty Crab (Sorcerer)**:
    - Additional Metamagic options at level 3
    - More spells with bonus action casting times
- **Zurkt (Paladin)**:
    - Various smite spells at level 2 (bonus action casting)
    - Channel Divinity options depending on Oath chosen at level 3
- **The Duke (Barbarian)**:
    - **Frenzy** (if Berserker Path is chosen at level 3): Make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action while frenzied
    - **Ancestral Protectors** (if Ancestral Guardian Path is chosen): Special spiritual effects when raging
    - **Beast Sense** (if Totem Warrior Path is chosen): Special animal-based abilities
    - **Storm Aura** (if Storm Herald Path is chosen): Environmental effects while raging
    - **Zealous Presence** (if Zealot Path is chosen): Divine power infuses their rage

### Tactical Considerations

- **Action Economy**: With The Duke's Rage and Xanorin's spells, your party has several ways to optimize their bonus actions for greater combat effectiveness.
- **Rage Synergy**: The Duke should activate Rage early in difficult combats to maximize the defensive benefits throughout the encounter.
- **Healing Efficiency**: Xanorin can cast Healing Word as a bonus action, allowing them to still take a regular action in the same turn.
- **Mobility**: Dusty Crab's Tempestuous Magic provides tactical repositioning without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Positioning**: Both The Duke and Zurkt will want to be in melee range, so coordinate their positions to avoid blocking each other.
