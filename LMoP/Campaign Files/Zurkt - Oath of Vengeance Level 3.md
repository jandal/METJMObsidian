**Date**: 1 October 2025
**Character**: Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin)
**Campaign**: Lost Mine of Phandelver

---

## Oath of Vengeance Overview

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil forces slaughter innocent villagers, when bandits terrorise the countryside, when cultists threaten civilisation itself, paladins of vengeance rise to deliver swift and terrible justice.

This oath resonates powerfully with Zurkt's backstory as a Haunted One who refuses to let others become victims.

---

## Tenets of Vengeance

Zurkt has sworn to uphold these principles:

### Fight the Greater Evil
Faced with choosing between fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

### No Mercy for the Wicked
Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

### By Any Means Necessary
My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

### Restitution
If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

**Note for Zurkt**: These tenets align with his determination that "no one should have to endure the horrors I've experienced." His oath channels his trauma into protective action.

## Channel Divinity (Two Options)

Zurkt gains **Channel Divinity**, which he can use once per short or long rest. He must choose which of these two options to use when activating Channel Divinity:

### 1. Abjure Enemy
**Action**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 feet  
**Duration**: 1 minute or until target takes damage

**Effect**:
- Choose one creature Zurkt can see within 60 feet
- Target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC = 8 + proficiency + Charisma modifier = **DC 9** for Zurkt)
- On a failed save:
  - Creature is **frightened** for 1 minute or until it takes damage
  - While frightened, creature's **speed is 0** and it can't benefit from speed bonuses
- On a successful save: creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until it takes damage
- **Fiends and undead** have **disadvantage** on this saving throw

**Tactical Use**: Excellent for locking down a dangerous enemy at the start of combat, especially boss monsters or powerful spellcasters. The 0 speed effect is devastating for melee enemies.

### 2. Vow of Enmity
**Bonus Action**: 1 bonus action  
**Range**: 10 feet  
**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**:
- Choose one creature Zurkt can see within 10 feet
- Zurkt gains **advantage on all attack rolls** against that creature for 1 minute (10 rounds)
- Effect ends early if the target drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious

**Tactical Use**: Zurkt's primary combat option. With his +5 to hit and greataxe damage, having advantage dramatically increases his damage output. Use this against the biggest threat in melee range.

**Synergy with Zurkt's Build**: Since Zurkt has a relatively low Charisma (-1 modifier), Vow of Enmity is likely his better option in most combats, as it doesn't rely on enemies failing saves.

## Oath Spells (Always Prepared)

Zurkt automatically knows these spells and always has them prepared. They **don't count** against his normal number of prepared spells.

### 1st Level Oath Spells
#### Bane
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Effect**: Up to 3 creatures must make a Charisma save or subtract 1d4 from all attack rolls and saving throws
- **Use Case**: Excellent debuff for groups of enemies or to weaken a boss's legendary resistances

#### Hunter's Mark
- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Effect**: 
  - Deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever Zurkt hits with an attack
  - Zurkt has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and (Survival) checks to find the target
  - If target drops to 0 HP, Zurkt can use a bonus action to move the mark to a new target
- **Use Case**: Outstanding damage boost! Combines excellently with Vow of Enmity for massive damage output

**IMPORTANT COMBO**: Zurkt can use Hunter's Mark (bonus action) on round 1, then on later rounds use Vow of Enmity (bonus action) on the same target for advantage + extra d6 damage per hit!

## Updated Spell List

Zurkt now has access to the following spells:

### Spells Always Prepared (Oath Spells)
- Bane (1st level)
- Hunter's Mark (1st level)

### Other Known Spells
- Cure Wounds (1st level)
- Shield of Faith (1st level)

### Total Prepared Spells at Level 3
Zurkt can prepare a number of spells equal to his Charisma modifier + half his paladin level (minimum 1 spell).
- Formula: -1 (Charisma) + 1 (half of level 3, rounded down) = **0**
- Since paladins can prepare a minimum of 1 spell, Zurkt can prepare **1 additional spell** beyond his Oath spells

**Current Recommendation**: Keep Cure Wounds prepared for emergency healing. Shield of Faith is also excellent (+2 AC bonus with Concentration).

### Spell Slots at Level 3
- **1st Level Slots**: 3 (increased from 2)
- Can still use spell slots for Lay on Hands conversion (5 HP per 1st level slot) or for Divine Smite

## Combat Strategy for Zurkt at Level 3

### Opening Round (Full Resources)
1. **Bonus Action**: Cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest threat
2. **Action**: Attack with Greataxe (+5 to hit, 1d12+3 slashing + 1d6 from Hunter's Mark)
3. **If you hit**: Consider using Divine Smite for an additional 2d8 radiant damage

**Damage Potential**: 1d12+3+1d6+2d8 = average of 24 damage in one hit!

### Round 2 (If facing a tough opponent)
1. **Bonus Action**: Use Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity
2. **Action**: Attack with advantage against marked target
3. **On hit**: Stack Hunter's Mark + Divine Smite for devastating damage

### Alternative Opening (Control Strategy)
1. **Action**: Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy (frighten and lock down the biggest threat)
2. **Move**: Position to protect squishier allies
3. Later rounds: Focus fire on controlled enemy or deal with other threats

### Sustained Combat
- Hunter's Mark lasts 1 hour, so Zurkt can move it from enemy to enemy throughout multiple encounters
- Save spell slots for critical Divine Smites or emergency healing
- Use Vow of Enmity against bosses or when fighting a single tough opponent

## Roleplaying Zurkt's Oath

### How the Oath Manifests
- **Vow of Enmity**: When Zurkt designates a foe, his eyes might crackle with lightning (Thunder Goblin heritage), and he speaks a guttural promise of vengeance in Goblin
- **Abjure Enemy**: Zurkt channels his traumatic past into a terrifying presence that reminds his foe of their own mortality and misdeeds
- **Hunter's Mark**: A spectral mark appears on the target, visible only to Zurkt, guiding his strikes

### Character Development
- Zurkt's oath reflects his determination that others won't suffer as he has
- The "By Any Means Necessary" tenet might conflict with Chaotic Good alignment—watch for interesting moral moments
- His distrust of divine beings makes his paladin powers interesting: perhaps he sees them as coming from his own conviction rather than divine grace
- The oath gives structure to his trauma response: "You refuse to become a victim and will not allow others to be victimized"

## Questions for Player

1. **Does Zurkt remember the specific event or being that haunts him?** This could inform who he considers "sworn enemies."

2. **How does Zurkt reconcile his distrust of divine beings with his paladin powers?** Does he view his abilities as willpower rather than divine gifts?

3. **What does Zurkt's holy symbol look like?** Thunder/storm themed? A reminder of his harrowing event?

4. **How does Zurkt's oath manifest visually?** Thunder and lightning effects? Grim determination?

## Next Session Preparation

- Ensure player understands Channel Divinity mechanics
- Discuss how Zurkt envisions his oath manifesting
- Clarify the difference between Abjure Enemy and Vow of Enmity use cases
- Consider creating a "sworn enemy" for Zurkt's personal quest

**DM Note**: The Oath of Vengeance is one of the strongest paladin subclasses for damage output. Zurkt will be a formidable combatant, especially with the Hunter's Mark + Vow of Enmity combo. Balance encounters accordingly!
