## Room 9: Guard Barracks

### Initial Setup
**What the Players See:**
> This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and old food permeates the air. The sound of snoring comes from two of the bunks.

### Occupants
- **2 Redbrand Ruffians** (currently sleeping)
- **Perception DC 15** to approach without waking them
- If combat starts, they shout for help (alerts nearby rooms)

### Combat Considerations
- **Surprise Round** possible if stealth approach succeeds
- Ruffians attempt to grab weapons (1 round delay if surprised)
- **Tactical Notes**: Room has limited cover, bunks can be overturned for partial cover

### Treasure
- **15 sp** scattered in personal belongings
- **Redbrand scarlet cloak** (evidence/disguise opportunity)
- **Crude map** showing local patrol routes around Phandalin

## Connecting Areas & Immediate Options

### Room 8: Cistern (South)
- **30-foot deep** water cistern
- **Waterlogged skeleton** at bottom (ancient, not plot-relevant)
- **Hidden rope** along east wall for climbing
- **Secret**: Contains **potion of healing** in waterproof case

### Room 10: Common Room (East)
- **3 Redbrand Ruffians** playing cards
- **Shouting from Room 9** brings them running in 2 rounds
- **Gambling stakes**: 12 cp, 8 sp on table

### Room 1: Crypt (North via corridor)
- **3 Skeletons** animate when disturbed
- **Stone sarcophagi** with ancient Tresendar family remains
- **Treasure**: Silver signet ring worth 20 gp

## Key Story Beats This Session

### 1. Stealth vs. Combat Choice
**Decision Point**: How to handle sleeping guards
- **Stealth Success**: Advantage on upcoming encounters
- **Combat Alert**: Tougher subsequent fights but direct approach

### 2. Information Gathering
**Interrogation Opportunity**: Captured Redbrands reveal:
- "**Glasstaff** is the boss - he's got magic!"
- "**The prisoners** are in the cells past the common room"
- "**Gundren Rockseeker** was brought through yesterday"

### 3. Resource Management
- **Healing Resources**: Zurkt's Lay on Hands, Xanorin's Cure Wounds
- **Spell Slots**: Dusty Crab should conserve higher-level slots
- **Rage**: The Duke should save for bigger fights ahead

---

## Anticipated Player Actions & Responses

### If They Attempt Stealth
- **Xanorin** leads with Stealth +3, advantage from Halfling Nimbleness
- **Success**: Surprised guards, easier fight
- **Failure**: Normal initiative, guards call for help

### If They Go Loud
- **The Duke** charges in with Greataxe
- **Zurkt** uses Thunder resistance tactically
- **Dusty Crab** opens with Twinned Chaos Bolt

### If They Try to Bypass
- **Cistern route** to Room 8 is possible but requires Athletics checks
- **Alternative**: Could attempt to climb to upper levels (advanced)

## DM Notes & Preparation

### Combat Quick Reference
**Redbrand Ruffian**: AC 11, HP 11, Shortsword +3 (1d6+1), Handaxe +3 (1d6+1)

### Improvisation Hooks
- **Zurkt's Background**: Haunted One might trigger memories of past trauma
- **Xanorin's Spy Skills**: Perfect for information gathering
- **Dusty Crab's Guild**: Might recognise craftsmanship in hideout construction

### Session Pacing
- **Room 9**: 20-30 minutes (including combat)
- **Exploration Phase**: 30-40 minutes (Rooms 8, 10, or 1)
- **Major Encounter**: Save energy for Room 2 (Nothic) or Room 5 (Glasstaff) next session

---

## Next Session Hooks

### Immediate Continuation
- **Room 2**: The Nothic encounter (significant roleplay opportunity)
- **Slave Pens**: Rescuing Mirna Dendrar and family
- **Glasstaff Confrontation**: Major boss encounter

### Long-term Campaign Threads
- **Gundren's Location**: Follow trail to Wave Echo Cave
- **Lords' Alliance**: Possible faction involvement through rescued NPCs
- **Tresendar Manor**: Upper level still unexplored

---

## Quick DM Reminders

### House Rules Check
- **Death Saves**: Standard rules or heroic?
- **Inspiration**: Award for creative problem-solving
- **Critical Hits**: Maximum damage + roll, or double dice?

### Player Engagement
- **The Duke**: Highlight military tactical knowledge
- **Xanorin**: Use spy background for insight into enemy operations
- **Dusty Crab**: Storm magic interactions with dungeon environment
- **Zurkt**: Divine sense for detecting undead in crypt areas

### Session Goals
1. **Advance the story** towards finding Gundren
2. **Build tension** around Glasstaff mystery
3. **Test party resources** before major encounters
4. **Reward clever tactics** and good roleplaying

*Remember: The Redbrand Hideout is about building tension towards the Glasstaff encounter whilst giving players agency in how they approach each room. Let their choices drive the pacing!*
