**Divine Visions:**

- Zurkt has been experiencing fragmented visions showing a great darkness spreading from the direction of Phandalin
- In these visions, a shadowy spider-like figure stands at the center of ancient ruins filled with unnatural magic
- Their divine patron has been sending warnings through prayers and meditations about an ancient evil stirring
- The visions sometimes include glimpses of a magical forge surrounded by undead guardians

**Cultural Knowledge as a Goblin:**

- Though Zurkt has rejected the violent ways of typical goblins, they might recognize the name "Cragmaw" if mentioned
- They could have knowledge about typical goblin tribal structures that might help predict the behavior of the Cragmaw goblins
- Their unusual status as a "thunder goblin" might create interesting roleplay opportunities when encountering other goblinoids
- They might sense that something has united the normally fractious goblin tribes in the region under stronger leadership

When Gundren mentions the lost mine, you could have Zurkt make a Religion check. On a good roll, they might recognize elements from their visions, feeling a chill of recognition or a subtle divine nudge confirming they're on the right path.
