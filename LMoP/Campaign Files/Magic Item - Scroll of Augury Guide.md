# Scroll of Augury - D&D 5e Guide

## Basic Information
**Type**: Spell Scroll, Uncommon  
**Spell**: Augury (2nd level Divination)  
**Classes Who Can Use**: Cleric, Druid, Wizard  
**Casting Time**: 1 minute (or as a ritual)  
**Material Components**: None required when cast from scroll

## What It Does
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

## The Four Possible Omens
The DM chooses from these responses:
- **Weal**: Good results will likely occur
- **Woe**: Bad results will likely occur  
- **Weal and Woe**: Both good and bad results will likely occur
- **Nothing**: Results that aren't especially good or bad

## Key Limitations & Rules

### Spell Scroll Usage
If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.

### Who Can Use This Scroll
From your party:
- **None of your current characters can use this scroll** - your party consists of:
  - Dusty Crab (Sorcerer) - Augury not on Sorcerer spell list
  - The Duke (Barbarian) - No spellcasting
  - Xanorin (Druid) - **Can use it!** Augury is on Druid spell list
  - Zurkt (Paladin) - Augury not on Paladin spell list

### Important Restrictions
The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.

## Perfect for Your Pit Trap Situation

### Example Usage
**Xanorin could cast**: "What will happen if we attempt to cross this trapped hallway?"

**Possible DM Responses**:
- **Weal**: "The bones show success - you sense safe passage awaits"
- **Woe**: "The sticks fall in ominous patterns - danger lies ahead"
- **Weal and Woe**: "The cards show mixed fortune - success but at a cost"
- **Nothing**: "The omens are unclear - neither great fortune nor disaster"

### Strategic Value
- **30-minute window**: Perfect for immediate tactical decisions
- **No spell slot cost**: Since it's from a scroll
- **Risk assessment**: Helps decide between direct crossing vs. alternative approaches

## Tactical Considerations

### Timing
- Takes 1 minute to cast (or 10 minutes as ritual)
- Must be about action taken within next 30 minutes
- Results apply to current circumstances only

### Interpretation
Augury allows the player character to engage in conversation with the GM - it's designed to give the DM a way to provide guidance without breaking immersion.

### Multiple Castings Risk
- First casting: Normal result
- Second casting same day: 25% chance of random/false reading
- Third casting same day: 50% chance of random/false reading
- And so on...

## Bottom Line
**Only Xanorin can use this scroll**, and it would be excellent for getting divine guidance about whether crossing the pit trap will go well or badly. It's essentially a "ask the DM for a hint" spell wrapped in mystical flavour!
