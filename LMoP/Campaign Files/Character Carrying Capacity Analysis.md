## D&D 5e Size and Carrying Capacity Rules Clarification

**Key Rule**: Small and Medium creatures have the same carrying capacity (Strength √ó 15). Only Tiny creatures have their carrying capacity halved, and creatures larger than Medium have it doubled for each size category above Medium.

- **Tiny**: Carrying capacity halved (Strength √ó 7.5)
- **Small & Medium**: Standard carrying capacity (Strength √ó 15)
- **Large**: Carrying capacity doubled (Strength √ó 30)
- **Huge**: Carrying capacity quadrupled (Strength √ó 60)
- **Gargantuan**: Carrying capacity √ó 8 (Strength √ó 120)

**Therefore, Zurkt (Small goblin) has the same carrying capacity as a Medium humanoid with the same Strength score.**

## Summary & Recommendations

### Current Status:
- **Dusty Crab**: Heavy Load (95.5/165 lbs) - Speed reduced by 10 ft
- **The Duke**: Heavy Load (104.5/210 lbs) - Speed reduced by 10 ft  
- **Xanorin**: üö® Heavily Encumbered (85.5/120 lbs) - Speed reduced by 20 ft, disadvantage on Str/Dex/Con rolls
- **Zurkt**: Heavy Load (118/255 lbs) - Speed reduced by 10 ft (NO SIZE PENALTY)

### Immediate Actions Needed:

#### For Xanorin (Critical):
Xanorin is suffering severe penalties and needs immediate help:
- **Remove 5.5 lbs minimum** to avoid heavy encumbrance penalties
- Consider having other party members carry:
  - Potions (1.5 lbs total)
  - Extra weapon (scimitar or sickle, 2-3 lbs)
  - Portion of rations from explorer's pack

#### For All Characters:
- **Distribute party equipment** more evenly
- **Zurkt can carry significantly more** (137 lbs available capacity)
- Consider purchasing a **pack animal** or **cart** for long journeys
- **Consume rations and torches** over time to reduce weight

### Equipment Redistribution Suggestions:

**Zurkt should carry**:
- Dusty Crab's longbow (2 lbs)
- Xanorin's scimitar (3 lbs) 
- Some potions for the party
- Extra rations from other party members [[rope-hempen-50-feet]]

**Result**: This would move Xanorin from heavily encumbered to heavy load, and all other characters remain manageable.

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Bag of Holding** (500 lb capacity, weighs 15 lbs)
2. **Pack animal** (mule, horse, or donkey)
3. **Portable Hole** for major expeditions
4. **Strength-enhancing items** (Belt of Giant Strength, Gauntlets of Ogre Power)
