# Short Rests and Long Rests in D&D 5e

Rests are crucial recovery periods that allow characters to regain resources, heal, and prepare for further adventures. The D&D 5e system includes two types of rests: short rests and long rests.

## DM Control of Rests

As the Dungeon Master, you have complete authority to determine when and where characters can take rests, particularly long rests. This is a crucial tool for game balance and narrative pacing.

### Legitimate Reasons to Deny a Long Rest

- **Unsafe Location**: "The howling of wolves and occasional roars make it impossible to truly rest in this forest."
- **Time Pressure**: "The ritual will be complete at dawn. You don't have 8 hours to spare."
- **Environmental Factors**: "The extreme cold means you can't remain still long enough for a proper rest."
- **Recent Rest**: "You completed a long rest just 6 hours ago. Your bodies aren't tired enough yet." (24-hour rule)
- **Interruptions**: "The constant patrol of goblin guards means you're disturbed every hour."

### How to Handle It

1. **Explain Why**: Always provide an in-world reason why a long rest isn't possible
2. **Offer Alternatives**: "You can't take a long rest here, but you could manage a short rest"
3. **Create Solutions**: "If you could find a way to secure this area or create shelter, then a long rest might be possible"

### Benefits to Game Balance

Controlling long rests is one of your most powerful tools for:

- Maintaining tension and stakes
- Creating meaningful resource management decisions
- Preventing the "15-minute adventuring day" problem (where players nova all abilities then rest)
- Making short-rest classes (like Warlocks and Fighters) shine

## Short Rests

|Aspect|Details|
|---|---|
|**Duration**|At least 1 hour|
|**Frequency**|Multiple per day|
|**Activities Allowed**|Light activity only: reading, talking, eating, drinking, standing watch, tending wounds|
|**Activities Not Allowed**|Fighting, casting spells, or any other strenuous activity|
|**Hit Point Recovery**|Spend any number of Hit Dice + Constitution modifier per die|
|**Resource Recovery**|• Warlock spell slots<br>• Monk ki points<br>• Fighter's Second Wind and Action Surge<br>• Bard's Song of Rest feature (additional healing)<br>• Channel Divinity<br>• Various class-specific abilities|

## Long Rests

|Aspect|Details|
|---|---|
|**Duration**|At least 8 hours|
|**Frequency**|Once per 24-hour period|
|**Activities Allowed**|• Sleeping for at least 6 hours<br>• Light activity for no more than 2 hours|

|**Interruptions**|• Can have brief interruptions (up to 1 hour total)<br>• Strenuous activity (1+ hour) restarts the rest period|
|**Hit Point Recovery**|Regain all lost hit points|

|**Requirements**|• Cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period<br>• Must have at least 1 hit point to gain benefits|

## Special Considerations

### Environmental Factors

- **Extreme Environments**: DMs may rule that resting in extreme cold, heat, or dangerous areas prevents characters from gaining some or all rest benefits
- **Safe Location**: While not strictly required by rules, DMs often require a relatively safe location for effective resting

### Class-Specific Interactions

- **Wizard's Arcane Recovery**: Allows recovery of some spell slots during a short rest (once per day)
- **Natural Explorer (Ranger)**: At higher levels, allows gaining benefits of a short rest in just 30 minutes
- **Catnap Spell**: Allows allies to gain the benefits of a short rest in just 10 minutes

### Optional Rules

- **Gritty Realism Variant**: Short rest = 8 hours, Long rest = 7 days
- **Epic Heroism Variant**: Short rest = 5 minutes, Long rest = 1 hour
- **Healing Surges Variant**: Limits healing during short rests

## Practical Application for DMs

- Typically, adventures are balanced around 2-3 short rests per long rest
- Short rests create natural breaks in dungeon exploration
- Long rests often mark the end of an adventuring day
- Controlling when and where players can safely rest is a key pacing tool
