# PC Undead Detection Analysis

## Characters' Abilities to Detect Animated Skeletons

### **Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin) - BEST DETECTION**
**Primary Detection Method: Divine Sense**
- **Ability**: Can detect celestials, fiends, or **undead** within 60 feet as an action
- **Mechanics**: Knows location of any undead within range (but not exact type)
- **Usage**: Limited uses per long rest (Charisma modifier + 1, minimum 1)
- **Effectiveness**: **EXCELLENT** - This is specifically designed to detect undead creatures
- **Limitations**: Requires an action to use, limited daily uses

### **Xanorin (Lightfoot Halfling Druid) - MODERATE DETECTION**
**Primary Detection Methods:**
1. **Faerie Fire Spell** (1st level)
   - Can outline creatures in coloured light, making hidden undead visible
   - 20-foot cube area of effect
   - Dexterity save to avoid being outlined
   
2. **Keen Perception** (+5 Perception modifier)
   - High passive Perception (15) might notice unusual details
   - Could spot signs like lack of breathing, unnatural stillness, or magical auras

3. **Wild Shape Forms**
   - **Beast forms with Keen Smell** (like wolves or bears) might detect the absence of life scent or presence of necromantic magic
   - **Spider/Web-sensing forms** might detect supernatural vibrations

**Effectiveness**: **GOOD** - Multiple options but less reliable than Divine Sense

### **Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer) - MINIMAL DETECTION**
**Potential Detection Methods:**
1. **Arcane Focus and Magical Intuition**
   - High Charisma (+4) and Arcana skill (+5) might allow recognition of magical auras
   - Sorcerous bloodline might provide instinctive awareness of magical creatures
   
2. **Known Spells** (Current spells don't include detection magic)
   - None of the current spell list provides undead detection
   - Could potentially learn *Detect Magic* as a future spell choice

**Effectiveness**: **LIMITED** - Would rely on general magical awareness

### **The Duke (Human Barbarian) - NO SPECIAL DETECTION**
**Detection Capabilities:**
- **Standard Perception** (Wisdom -1, so Perception -1)
- No class features that provide supernatural detection
- Would rely entirely on visual observation and combat instincts

**Effectiveness**: **POOR** - Only basic observation skills

## Tactical Recommendations

### **For Animated Skeletons in Combat/Exploration:**

1. **Have Zurkt use Divine Sense** when the party suspects undead presence
   - 60-foot range covers most room sizes
   - Provides definitive confirmation of undead presence
   - Can be used before entering suspicious areas

2. **Xanorin's Faerie Fire** as secondary detection
   - Useful if skeletons are hiding or lying amongst normal bones
   - Creates tactical advantage by outlining enemies for combat
   - 20-foot cube can cover multiple potential skeleton locations

3. **Environmental Cues for All Characters:**
   - **Visual**: Skeletons posed too perfectly, weapons nearby, magical runes
   - **Atmospheric**: Unusual cold, sense of dread, magical energy
   - **Contextual**: Location history (battlefields, crypts, necromancer lairs)

### **Skeleton Ambush Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Lying Amongst Real Bones:**
- Zurkt's Divine Sense would immediately reveal animated vs. normal bones
- Party could prepare for combat or attempt to avoid

**Scenario B - Hidden in Alcoves/Behind Cover:**
- High passive Perception (Xanorin) might notice details
- Divine Sense would still detect them within range
- Faerie Fire could reveal hidden positions

**Scenario C - Magical Concealment:**
- Divine Sense works regardless of invisibility or illusion
- This makes Zurkt invaluable against magically hidden undead

## Story Integration

Given that **Zurkt has the strongest anti-undead abilities**, consider:
- His Haunted One background could tie to previous undead encounters
- Thunder Goblin heritage might have innate sensitivity to unnatural creatures  
- His distrust and protective nature align with hunting undead threats
- Divine Sense represents his oath to protect others from supernatural horrors

The party's **detection hierarchy**:
1. **Zurkt** (Divine Sense) - Primary undead detector
2. **Xanorin** (Multiple methods) - Secondary support and tactical advantage
3. **Dusty Crab** (Magical intuition) - General arcane awareness
4. **The Duke** (Basic observation) - Combat readiness and protection

This creates natural party roles and emphasises teamwork in dealing with undead threats.
