## Key Events

### Arrival at the Stonehill Inn

- Following Sildar's recommendation about the inn having good lodgings
- **Zurkt's Reception**:
    - Initially harassed by townspeople on the street and in the pub due to being a goblin

    - Dedicated to single-handedly changing perceptions of all goblins
    - Still faces distrust from local ruffians despite his efforts

### Party Activities at the Inn

**The Duke:**

- Immediately began drinking beer and ale, becoming quite drunk
- Noticed soldiers in the corner and checked in with them

**Xanorin (Halfling Druid):**

- Multiple plot threads are emerging naturally
- Party dynamics (drunk Duke, diplomatic Zurkt, networking Dusty Crab) creating memorable moments

## Questions the Team Need to Answer

Now that the party is settled at the pub for breakfast and Sildar is much better, they need to address several pressing questions:

### Immediate Action Items:
1. **Where is Iarno Albrek?** - Sildar's contact has gone missing. Do they investigate his disappearance first?
2. **What to do about the Redbrand Ruffians?** - They're terrorising the town and have taken over the Sleeping Giant tavern. Confront them directly or gather more intelligence first?
3. **Who leads the Redbrands?** - The identity of their leader could be crucial to stopping them.
4. **Should they investigate the Sleeping Giant tavern?** - It's the Redbrands' stronghold but could be dangerous.

### Strategic Decisions:
5. **How to approach the Black Spider investigation?** - This seems connected to Gundren's capture but the trail is cold.
6. **Gundren Rockseeker's rescue priority** - He's at Cragmaw Castle, but do they have enough information to mount a rescue?
7. **Local authority** - Is there any official law enforcement in Phandalin they should coordinate with?
8. **Resource allocation** - How much time to spend investigating versus taking direct action?

### Information Gathering:
9. **Other locations in Phandalin to investigate** - What other establishments or people might have useful information?
10. **Sildar's knowledge** - Now that he's recovered, what else can he tell them about Iarno, the area, or the situation?
11. **Guild and spy network resources** - How can Dusty Crab and Xanorin best utilise their contacts?
12. **Local shrines and religious connections** - Zurkt expressed interest in local religious sites; could these provide sanctuary or information?

### Tactical Considerations:
13. **Party readiness** - The Duke is still recovering from drinking; are they in fighting condition?
14. **Equipment and supplies** - Do they need additional gear before taking on the Redbrands?
15. **Backup plans** - If they confront the Redbrands and things go poorly, what's their exit strategy?

The party needs to prioritise these questions and decide on their next course of action whilst they have the safety and comfort of the Stonehill Inn as their base of operations.
