# Understanding Hit Dice Recovery - A Detailed Explanation

Let me break down the hit dice recovery mechanism more thoroughly, as this is crucial for managing your party's resources as a DM.

## Hit Dice Recovery: Step-by-Step

**The Basic Rule:** After a long rest, you regain hit dice equal to **half your total number of hit dice (minimum of 1)**.

### Working Through Examples

**Example 1: Single-Class Character**

- Zurkt is a 6th-level Fighter
- Total hit dice: 6d10
- After a long rest, he recovers: 6 ÷ 2 = 3 hit dice
- If he'd spent all 6 during the previous day's adventuring, he'd wake up with 3d10 available

**Example 2: Tracking Over Multiple Days**

Let's follow a 5th-level Rogue through several days:

**Day 1 - Heavy Combat:**

- Starts with 5d8 hit dice
- Morning dungeon crawl: short rest, spends 2d8
- Remaining: 3d8
- Afternoon ambush: short rest, spends 2d8
- Remaining: 1d8
- **Long rest that night:** Recovers 2d8 (half of 5, rounded down)
- Wakes up Day 2 with: 3d8

**Day 2 - Moderate Exploration:**

- Starts with 3d8
- One combat: short rest, spends 1d8
- Remaining: 2d8
- **Long rest that night:** Recovers 2d8 (half of 5)
- Wakes up Day 3 with: 4d8

**Day 3 - Light Activity:**

- Starts with 4d8
- No hit dice spent
- **Long rest that night:** Recovers 2d8 (half of 5)
- Wakes up Day 4 with: 5d8 (back to maximum)

### The Key Insight

The recovery rate creates a mathematical ceiling: you can never recover more than half your level per long rest. This means:

- **If you're burning through hit dice faster than you can recover them, you're in an unsustainable situation**
- A party that spends 4+ hit dice per character per day will gradually deplete their reserves
- After 2-3 days of heavy adventuring, even with long rests, characters will be running on empty

This is intentional design—it prevents endless dungeon crawling and creates natural story breaks.

## Multiclassing Hit Dice Recovery

If you have multiclassed characters, they choose which dice to recover:

**Example: Dusty Crab (Fighter 3/Rogue 2)**

- Total hit dice: 3d10 + 2d8
- Total level: 5
- Recovery: 2 hit dice (5 ÷ 2, rounded down)
- **Dusty chooses** which to recover—probably the d10s first as they're more valuable

# Long Rests: Rules and DM Guidance

## The Official Rules (PHB p. 186)

A long rest is a period of **extended downtime, at least 8 hours long**, during which a character:

- Sleeps for at least 6 hours
- Performs no more than 2 hours of light activity (standing watch, reading, talking, eating, etc.)

**Benefits of a Long Rest:**

- Regain all lost hit points
- Regain half your total hit dice (minimum 1)
- Regain all spent spell slots
- Regain class features (like Action Surge, Wild Shape uses, etc.)
- Remove one level of exhaustion

**Important Restrictions:**

- A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period
- The rest is interrupted if you perform more than 1 hour of strenuous activity (fighting, casting spells, similar adventuring activity)
- If interrupted, you must restart the long rest to gain any benefit

## When Should You Allow Long Rests? (The DM's Dilemma)

This is one of the most challenging aspects of DMing because the rules say players can _attempt_ a long rest whenever they want, but you control the environment and consequences. Here's my guidance:

### The Spectrum of Approaches

**Lenient Approach (Easy Mode):**

- Players can long rest whenever they find 8 hours of safety
- Good for new players learning the game
- Makes resource management less punishing
- Risk: Trivialises the adventuring day

**Moderate Approach (Recommended for Most Games):**

- Players can long rest in safe locations without consequences
- Attempting to rest in dangerous locations has risks
- Time pressure and consequences create tension
- Balances player agency with meaningful choices

**Strict Approach (Gritty/Realistic):**

- Long rests only in truly safe havens (towns, fortified camps)
- Sleeping in dungeons is extremely risky
- Creates high tension and resource scarcity
- Can feel punishing if not communicated clearly

### Practical Guidelines for Your Table

**Safe Locations (Allow Long Rests Freely):**

- Towns and cities
- Friendly settlements
- Secured buildings or strongholds
- Peaceful wilderness far from threats
- Magically protected areas

**Risky Locations (Allow, But With Consequences):**

- Dungeons where enemies remain
- Hostile wilderness
- Enemy territory
- Near active threats

**How to Handle Risky Rest Attempts:**

1. **Telegraph the Risk:**
    
    - "You can try to rest here, but this dungeon is still crawling with goblins who'll be searching for you."
    - "The forest is dangerous at night—you might be interrupted."
2. **Use Interruptions Meaningfully:**
    
    - Random encounter during the night (doesn't necessarily ruin the rest)
    - Enemies reinforce or prepare defences (changes the tactical situation)
    - Time-sensitive objectives progress (the hostage is moved, ritual completes)
3. **Failed Rest Scenarios:**
    
    - If combat occurs for more than 1 hour of the 8-hour rest, it fails
    - They've wasted time and resources
    - They might need to retreat or find a safer location

### Time Pressure: Your Best Tool

Instead of arbitrarily denying rests, create situations where resting has consequences:

**Examples:**

- "You can rest here, but the captives mentioned the Red Brands check on them every morning. That's in about 6 hours."
- "Resting here would give Glasstaff time to flee with the evidence you're seeking."
- "The town is under attack—every hour you rest, more civilians die."

This puts the choice on your players: Do we push forward exhausted, or rest and accept the consequences?

### The "Adventuring Day" Problem

The game is balanced around 6-8 medium-to-hard encounters per long rest, but most sessions don't reach this:

**Solutions:**

1. **Multiple Encounters Per Day:**
    
    - Plan 2-3 encounters between long rests minimum
    - Use time pressure to prevent rest spam
    - Create connected encounters (alarm raises reinforcements)
2. **Gritty Realism Variant (DMG p. 267):**
    
    - Short rest = 8 hours
    - Long rest = 7 days
    - Makes each adventuring day last several sessions
    - Radically changes pacing—communicate this clearly!
3. **Epic Heroism Variant (DMG p. 267):**
    
    - Short rest = 5 minutes
    - Long rest = 1 hour
    - For high-action, video game-style campaigns
    - Makes resource management less important
4. **Modified Rest Rules (Homebrew):**
    
    - Only allow long rests in safe havens
    - Hit dice recover at a different rate
    - Consider your campaign's tone and pacing needs

### My Recommendation for Your Game

Based on your campaign being Lost Mine of Phandelver:

**For Part 2 (Phandalin and Surroundings):**

1. **In Phandalin:** Long rests are freely available—it's their home base
2. **In Dungeons:** Make resting risky but possible
    - Clearly state when areas are "cleared" and safe
    - If they rest in an active dungeon, have logical consequences (enemies regroup, set ambushes, flee with treasure)
3. **Wilderness Travel:** Generally safe with proper precautions (watches, hidden camp)

**Create Tension Through Choice, Not Denial:**

- "You've cleared the western caves, but you can hear goblin voices deeper in. Do you want to rest here, push forward, or return to town?"
- Let them weigh the options: safety vs. time vs. tactical advantage

**Set Expectations Early:**

- Tell your players: "In dungeons, I'll let you know when areas feel safe to rest. If you rest somewhere dangerous, there might be consequences."
- This transparency prevents arguments later

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't:**

- Arbitrarily say "no, you can't rest" without in-world justification
- Punish every rest attempt—this creates adversarial play
- Let players rest spam without consequences—this trivialises resource management
- Be inconsistent—if resting in the goblin cave was safe last time, why not now?

**Do:**

- Give players meaningful choices
- Telegraph risks clearly
- Be consistent with your world's logic
- Adjust difficulty based on their rest decisions

## Practical Application for Your Campaign

**Scenario: The party has just fought through half of Cragmaw Hideout**

**Player:** "We're beat up. Can we take a long rest in this cave?"

**Poor Response:** "No, you can't rest in a dungeon." (Arbitrary)

**Better Response:** "You can try, but you know there are more goblins deeper in the cave. If you rest here for 8 hours, what precautions are you taking? And are you worried about the captured supplies being moved or Sildar being interrogated while you sleep?"

This empowers your players to make informed decisions while maintaining stakes and tension.

# When Can the Party Take a Short Rest?

**The short answer: Whenever they want to commit 1 hour of in-game time and can find a place to do it.**

Unlike long rests, there's **no limit** on how many short rests you can take per day. The only restrictions are time and safety.

---

## The Official Rules

From the Player's Handbook (p. 186):

**Short Rest Requirements:**

- At least 1 hour long
- Nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds
- No limit on frequency (can take multiple per day)

**That's it.** There are no other official restrictions.

---

## Practical Limitations (The Real Constraints)

While the rules allow unlimited short rests, practical factors limit them:

### 1. **Time Pressure**

Every hour spent resting is an hour the world moves forward:

**Examples from LMoP:**

- Resting in Cragmaw Hideout gives goblins time to:
    
    - Discover cleared areas
    - Reinforce positions
    - Interrogate or move Sildar
    - Send for help
- Resting near Redbrand Hideout means:
    
    - Glasstaff might escape
    - Prisoners might be harmed
    - Evidence could be destroyed
    - The town remains in danger another hour

### 2. **Safety Concerns**

The party needs somewhere they won't be attacked:

**Safe-ish Locations:**

- Cleared dungeon rooms (if they barricade)
- Hidden wilderness spots
- Secured buildings
- Areas far from enemies

**Dangerous Locations:**

- Active dungeon corridors
- Middle of battlefields
- Enemy patrol routes
- Obviously exposed areas

### 3. **Narrative Logic**

Taking 3-4 short rests to clear a small goblin cave breaks immersion:

- "We fight for 30 seconds, rest for an hour, fight 30 seconds, rest for an hour..."
- This feels gamey and unrealistic
- The world should react to this behaviour

---

## Your Role as DM: Consequences, Not Restrictions

**Don't say:** "No, you can't rest here."

**Instead ask:** "You want to rest for an hour? What precautions are you taking, and are you aware of the risks?"

Then apply **logical consequences** based on their situation:

### Example Consequences

**Scenario: Party wants to short rest after every single encounter in Cragmaw Hideout**

**First Rest (After Cave Entrance):**

- _"You rest for an hour at the cave entrance. It's quiet. At the end of the hour, who's spending hit dice?"_
- **Consequence:** None—this is reasonable

**Second Rest (After Wolf Cave):**

- _"You barricade the door and settle in. About 20 minutes in, you hear goblin voices and footsteps in the corridor outside. They try the door once, find it barred, and you hear them moving away. The hour completes."_
- **Consequence:** Minor scare, but successful rest. The goblins are now aware intruders are in the hideout.

**Third Rest Attempt (After Bridge Encounter):**

- _"As you're setting up camp, you hear a horn blow deeper in the cave—three sharp blasts. You hear scrambling and shouting in Goblin. What do you do?"_
- **Consequence:** The alarm has been raised. Klarg is gathering defenders and preparing an ambush. Yeemik is threatening to execute Sildar.

**Fourth Rest Attempt:**

- _"You can try, but you can hear goblins organizing a search party. It sounds like a lot of them. If you stay here for an hour, they'll almost certainly find you."_
- **Consequence:** If they insist, they're attacked mid-rest and gain no benefits.

### The Pattern

Notice how I'm **not forbidding rests**, but making each successive rest more dangerous and consequential. The players must weigh:

- "Are we healed enough to push forward?"
- "Can we afford another hour?"
- "Is this location actually safe?"

---

## Frequency Guidelines (What's Reasonable?)

Here's how to think about short rest frequency:

### Typical Adventuring Day

**Reasonable Frequency:**

- **1-3 short rests per long rest** for most groups
- Usually after 2-3 encounters
- Taken at natural narrative breaks

**Example Timeline:**

- 8am: Leave town
- 10am: Encounter 1 (bandits on road)
- 11am: Encounter 2 (reach dungeon, fight guards)
- 12pm: **Short Rest** (secure entrance)
- 1pm: Encounter 3 (dungeon room 1)
- 2pm: Encounter 4 (dungeon room 2)
- 3pm: **Short Rest** (barricade cleared area)
- 4pm: Encounter 5 (boss fight)
- 5pm: **Short Rest** (victory celebration, loot division)
- 6pm: Travel back to town
- 8pm: Long rest in town

This is 3 short rests across 6 encounters—perfectly reasonable pacing.

### Red Flag: Rest Spamming

**Problem Behaviour:**

- Resting after every single encounter
- Resting before they actually need healing
- Treating short rests like video game save points

**Why It's a Problem:**

- Breaks immersion and narrative flow
- Trivialises resource management
- Makes classes with short rest recovery (Warlock, Fighter, Monk) overpowered
- Slows real-world play time to a crawl

**How to Address It:**

**Option 1: Time Pressure (Recommended)** Create situations where excessive resting has clear costs:

- "You've been in this dungeon for 6 hours now. Night is falling, and you're not back in town..."
- "Every hour you rest is another hour the kidnapped merchant is in danger."

**Option 2: Wandering Monsters** Use random encounter checks for excessive resting in dangerous areas:

- First rest: Safe
- Second rest: 10% chance per 10 minutes
- Third rest: 25% chance per 10 minutes
- Fourth rest+: 50% chance per 10 minutes

**Option 3: Narrative Consequences** Let the world progress realistically:

- Enemies flee with treasure/hostages
- Reinforcements arrive
- The BBEG completes their ritual
- Other adventurers claim the reward

**Option 4: Talk to Your Players** Sometimes just having a conversation works:

- "I've noticed we're resting after every fight. Is the difficulty too high, or are you being overly cautious?"
- Adjust encounter difficulty if they're genuinely struggling
- Explain how excessive resting affects pacing and immersion

## Class Considerations

Some classes **love** short rests more than others:

**Short Rest Dependent Classes:**

- **Warlock:** Regains all spell slots
- **Fighter:** Regains Action Surge, Second Wind
- **Monk:** Regains all Ki points
- **Wizard (Arcane Recovery):** Regains some spell slots
- **Bard (Song of Rest):** Helps the whole party heal more

**Long Rest Dependent Classes:**

- **Paladin:** Spell slots only return on long rest
- **Cleric:** Spell slots only return on long rest
- **Wizard (most features):** Spell slots return on long rest

If your party has Warlocks or Monks, expect them to **push for more frequent short rests**. This is normal and intended—these classes are balanced around having 2-3 short rests per adventuring day.

---

## Practical Guidelines for Your Table

### Clear Communication

**Set expectations in Session Zero or early sessions:**

_"Short rests take an hour in-game time. You can take as many as you want, but the world keeps moving. If you rest in a dangerous place or take a long time to clear a dungeon, there will be logical consequences. I won't arbitrarily say 'no,' but I will apply realistic cause and effect."_

### The "Cleared Area" Signal

**Help your players identify safe rest spots:**

_"You've defeated all the goblins in this section. The doors are barred, and it's quiet. This feels like a good place to catch your breath if you want."_

This tells them: "You've earned a rest here without consequences."

### Natural Rest Points

**Design adventures with obvious rest opportunities:**

- Cleared sections of dungeons
- Safe rooms or shrines
- Natural breaks in the narrative
- After major encounters

**LMoP Example (Cragmaw Hideout):**

- **Rest Point 1:** After clearing the entrance (cave mouth)
- **Rest Point 2:** After defeating Klarg (goblin den cleared)
- **Rest Point 3:** After rescuing Sildar (mission accomplished)

These feel natural and don't break immersion.

---

## Specific Scenarios for Your Campaign

### Scenario 1: The Eager Short Rest

**Players:** "Can we take a short rest?"

**You (assess the situation):**

- Where are they? (Dungeon, wilderness, town?)
- How much time has passed? (Are they just stalling?)
- What's happening in the world? (Time pressure?)
- Are they actually hurt? (Or just being cautious?)

**Your Response Options:**

**If reasonable:** _"Sure, you find a defensible spot and take an hour to rest. Who's keeping watch? And who's spending hit dice?"_

**If risky:** _"You can try. This corridor is pretty exposed, and you heard goblin patrols earlier. What precautions are you taking?"_

**If excessive:** _"You've already rested twice in the last two hours. The dungeon is definitely aware of your presence now—you hear alarmed voices and running footsteps. Do you still want to rest here?"_

### Scenario 2: The "Can We Rest Here?" Question

This question is actually asking: **"Is this location safe enough?"**

**Your job: Give them information to make an informed decision**

_"The room is small with one door. You've barricaded it. You can hear distant sounds of the hideout—shouts, footsteps, doors closing—but nothing immediately near you. It seems reasonably safe for now, though you're definitely still in hostile territory."_

Then let them decide. If they rest, they might be:

- Completely fine
- Interrupted (combat = rest fails)
- Discovered but talk their way out
- Fine now, but consequences later (enemies prepare)

### Scenario 3: The Marathon Dungeon

**Players want a short rest after every room.**

**First time:** _"Okay, you rest. An hour passes without incident."_

**Second time:** _"You rest again. You hear patrols passing by but they don't find you."_

**Third time:** _"As you settle in to rest, you hear a horn blow—three sharp blasts. The whole hideout is now on alert. What do you do?"_

**Message sent:** You can rest, but there are consequences to taking too long.

---

## The Bottom Line

### When Can They Short Rest?

**Technically:** Whenever they want

**Practically:** Whenever they can afford the time and find relative safety

**Your job as DM:**

- Don't arbitrarily forbid rests
- Apply logical consequences
- Create time pressure and stakes
- Reward good tactical decisions
- Punish reckless or excessive resting

### The Golden Rule

**"Yes, and..." not "No."**

- "Yes, you can rest here, **and** you'll need to post a guard."
- "Yes, you can rest again, **and** the goblins are definitely regrouping now."
- "Yes, you can take a third rest, **and** you hear the sounds of the hideout being abandoned—they're fleeing with Sildar."

This keeps player agency while maintaining stakes and tension.

---

## Quick Reference for You as DM

**When players ask to short rest, ask yourself:**

1. **How much time has passed?** (Immersion check)
2. **Is this location reasonable?** (Safety check)
3. **What's happening in the world?** (Consequence check)
4. **Have they rested recently?** (Pacing check)

Then respond with information and let them decide:

_"You can try to rest here. It'll take an hour. [Describe the risks/situation]. What do you want to do?"_
