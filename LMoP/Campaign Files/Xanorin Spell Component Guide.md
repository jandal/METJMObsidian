# Xanorin's Spell Component Guide

## Druidic Focus
**Your sprig of mistletoe** serves as your druidic focus. This replaces the need for most material components **unless the spell specifically lists a component with a gold piece cost**. You hold or wear your focus when casting spells.

## Concentration Rules Summary

**What Concentration Means:**
- You can only concentrate on **one spell at a time**
- Casting another concentration spell immediately ends the first one
- You can end concentration voluntarily at any time (no action required)
- Concentration ends if you're incapacitated or die

**Breaking Concentration:**
- **Taking Damage**: Make a Constitution saving throw
  - DC = 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher
  - Your modifier is +0, so you need to roll 10+ (or higher depending on damage)
  - **Example**: You take 8 damage → DC 10 save. You take 30 damage → DC 15 save
- **Being Incapacitated**: Automatically breaks concentration
- **Environmental Effects**: Some spells or effects specifically break concentration

**Your Concentration Spells:**
- Entangle (1st level) - battlefield control
- Faerie Fire (1st level) - grants advantage to allies
- Moonbeam (2nd level) - ongoing damage

**Tactical Considerations:**
- You can't concentrate on Entangle and Moonbeam at the same time
- Wild Shape **does not break concentration** - you can maintain concentration spells whilst transformed!
- Consider which concentration spell is most valuable for the current situation
- Position yourself safely when concentrating on important spells

---

## Wild Shape and Spellcasting

**Can you cast spells in Wild Shape?**
- **No** - you can't cast spells whilst in beast form (no verbal, somatic, or material components)

**Can you maintain concentration in Wild Shape?**
- **Yes!** - You can keep concentrating on spells you cast before transforming
- Example: Cast Moonbeam, then Wild Shape into a Brown Bear whilst maintaining concentration on the beam

**Can you use spell slots in Wild Shape?**
- **Yes** - Circle of the Moon feature lets you spend spell slots to heal yourself whilst in beast form
- Spend a spell slot as a bonus action to regain 1d8 hit points per spell slot level
- Example: Spend a 2nd-level slot to heal 2d8 hit points whilst you're a bear

**Tactical Combo:**
- Cast a concentration spell (like Faerie Fire or Moonbeam)
- Use bonus action to Wild Shape into a combat form (Brown Bear, Dire Wolf)
- Maintain concentration on the spell whilst fighting in beast form
- Use spell slots to heal yourself if needed
- This makes you incredibly versatile!

## Material Component Rules - Summary

**Your Druidic Focus (Sprig of Mistletoe):**
- Replaces **all** material components that don't have a listed cost
- You must hold or wear it to cast spells requiring material components
- It's not consumed when you cast spells
- Keep it safe - without it, you can't cast most of your spells!

**Components That DO Have Costs:**
- None of your current spells require costly material components
- If a spell says "a pearl worth at least 100 gp" or similar, you'd need to actually buy and carry that specific item
- These costly components are consumed by the spell only if the spell says "(consumed)"

**What You Actually Need:**
- **For most spells**: Just your sprig of mistletoe
- **For Shillelagh**: Your mistletoe + the weapon you're enchanting
- **For spells with only V (Verbal)**: Just speak the words, no materials needed
- **For spells with V, S (Somatic)**: Speak and gesture, no materials needed
