## Recommendations by Character

### Dusty Crab
**Current Status**: Well-equipped for a sorcerer
**Suggested Purchases**:
- **More darts**: 4 cp 5 cp each (useful thrown weapons)
- **Crossbow bolts**: 9 sp per 20 (replenish ammunition)
- **Sling**: 9 cp (alternative ranged option, very cheap)

**Reasoning**: As a sorcerer, Dusty relies primarily on spells. The current arsenal of ranged options (crossbow, longbow, darts) is more than adequate. Focus gold on spell components, potions, or utility items instead.

### The Duke
**Current Status**: Solid weapon selection for a barbarian
**Gold Concern**: Only 20 gp available
**Suggested Purchases**:
- **Javelins (2-4)**: 4 sp 5 cp each (ranged throwing option)
- **More handaxes**: 4 gp 5 sp each (versatile thrown/melee)

**Reasoning**: The Duke lacks ranged options. Javelins or additional handaxes would provide throwing weapons for engaging distant enemies whilst keeping gold for other necessities. With Rage active, strength-based throwing weapons benefit from the damage bonus.

**Alternative**: Save gold for healing potions or better armour once funds increase.

### Xanorin
**Current Status**: Adequately equipped
**Suggested Purchases**:
- **Javelins (3-5)**: 4 sp 5 cp each (ranged option for humanoid form)
- **Additional darts**: 4 cp 5 cp each (cheap ranged backup)
- **Spear**: 9 sp (versatile option, can be thrown)

**Reasoning**: As a Circle of the Moon druid, Xanorin spends significant combat time in Wild Shape. However, having ranged options for humanoid form is tactically important. Javelins and spears are excellent choices as they can be thrown or used in melee with versatile properties.

**Important Note**: Druids avoid metal weapons when possible. Ensure these are wooden/organic variants.

### Zurkt
**Current Status**: Well-armed with multiple morningstars and axes
**Suggested Purchases**:
- **Javelins (3-5)**: 4 sp 5 cp each (ranged option)
- **Consider nothing**: Already has multiple weapon options

**Reasoning**: Zurkt has multiple melee weapons but no ranged options except the single handaxe. Javelins would provide throwing capability without significant investment. However, as a paladin with limited gold, prioritise healing items and potentially a shield if one isn't already equipped.

---

## Tactical Considerations

### Ranged Weapon Gap
**Party Weakness**: The Duke and Zurkt lack effective ranged options beyond throwing their melee weapons. This leaves them vulnerable when enemies stay at distance or fly.

**Solution**: Invest in javelins or throwing weapons. They're inexpensive and provide tactical flexibility.

### Ammunition Management
**Current Stocks**:
- Dusty Crab: 40 crossbow bolts
- Party lacks spare arrows for the longbow Dusty is carrying

**Recommendation**: Purchase ammunition reserves (arrows and bolts) whilst in town. Combat can rapidly deplete supplies.

### Weapon Properties to Consider
- **Versatile**: Weapons that can be used one or two-handed (quarterstaffs, spears, longswords)
- **Reach**: Weapons that can attack from 10 feet away (glaives, halberds, pikes, whips)
- **Finesse**: Can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attacks (important for Dusty's dagger use)
- **Light**: Can be used for two-weapon fighting

### Special Purchases Worth Considering
- **Net** (9 sp with discount): Excellent for capturing enemies alive or restraining dangerous foes. Zurkt already has one.
- **Whip** (1 gp 8 sp with discount): Reach weapon that uses Finesse, allowing Dexterity-based attacks at 10 feet.

## Budget Summary

| Character | Available Gold | Recommended Spend |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Dusty Crab | 60 gp | 2-5 gp (ammunition and backup weapons) |
| The Duke | 20 gp | 2-6 gp (javelins or handaxes) |
| Xanorin | 85 gp | 2-5 gp (javelins and ranged options) |
| Zurkt | Unknown | 2-5 gp (javelins if budget allows) |

**Total Recommended Investment**: 8-21 gp across the party

This leaves substantial reserves for healing potions, adventuring gear, and unexpected expenses.

## Additional Notes

### Selling Weapons
If any character wishes to sell weapons, Linene typically offers 50% of the listed price for weapons in good condition.

### Custom Orders
For unusual weapons or special materials, Linene can place orders with her guild contacts in larger cities. Delivery would take 1-2 weeks and likely incur a 20-30% premium over standard prices.

### Silvered Weapons
Linene does not currently stock silvered weapons, but she can arrange to have weapons silvered for 100 gp per weapon. This process takes 1 week. Silvered weapons are essential for overcoming resistance to non-magical damage that some creatures (particularly lycanthropes and devils) possess.
