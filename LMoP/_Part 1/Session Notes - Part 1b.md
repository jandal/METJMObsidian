- **The Duke** - Human Barbarian
- **Xanorin** - Lightfoot Halfling Druid
- **Zurkt** - Thunder Goblin Paladin

## Session Overview

The adventurers continued their quest to rescue Gundren Rockseeker, beginning their exploration of the Cragmaw Hideout after having defeated the goblin ambushers outside.

## Key Events

### Approach to the Hideout

- The session began with the party taking a short rest outside the Cragmaw Hideout after defeating the goblin sentries.
- After discussing their approach, Xanorin used Wild Shape to transform into a wolf to better scout the cave entrance.
- The party cautiously entered the cave, with Xanorin (in wolf form) and Zurkt taking the lead.

### Cave Entrance and Wolf Encounter (Area 3)

- Upon entering the cave, the party immediately discovered three wolves chained to iron stakes on their right.
- The wolves were agitated and attempting to break free from their restraints.
- Rather than risk the wolves breaking loose later, the party engaged them in combat.
- After a brief but intense battle, the party defeated all three wolves.

### Exploring the Fissure

- Dusty Crab and Zurkt attempted to climb up a narrow fissure in the cave wall.
- At the top of the fissure, they caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a bugbear (a large goblinoid creature) and heard the growling of another wolf.
- Recognising they might be outmatched, they carefully retreated back down the fissure.

### Navigating the Stream

- The party decided to follow the stream flowing through the cave.
- While moving along the stream, they spotted a goblin's foot briefly visible from a hidden position.
- They quickly moved to the side to avoid being seen.

### The Steep Passage (Area 4)

- The adventurers navigated up a steep passage in the cave.
- As they reached the top of the passage, the party was spotted by a group of goblins.

### Goblin Den Battle (Area 6)

- The party encountered five goblins positioned on a raised ledge in a larger chamber.
- A fierce battle ensued as the adventurers fought their way up onto the ledge.
- After defeating the goblins, the party discovered a human prisoner tied to a chair in the corner of the chamber.
- This prisoner was identified as Sildar Hallwinter, Gundren Rockseeker's escort who had been captured alongside him.

## Session End

The session concluded with the discovery of Sildar Hallwinter, with the party poised to learn more about Gundren's fate and the mysterious Cragmaw tribe.
