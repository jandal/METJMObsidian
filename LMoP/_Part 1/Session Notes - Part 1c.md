# Session 1C Summary - Cragmaw Hideout: The Deal with Yeemik

## Key Events

### The Hostage Situation
- The party approached the unconscious body of **Sildar Hallwinter** in the goblin den
- **Yeemik**, the goblin lieutenant, emerged holding a knife to Sildar's throat
- Yeemik demanded the party halt their advance and called for negotiations

### The Devil's Bargain
Through a combination of **persuasion and intimidation**, the party struck a deal with Yeemik:
- **Terms**: If the party brings back the severed head of **Klarg** (the bugbear leader), Yeemik will release Sildar unharmed
- **Condition**: The adventurers must promise to depart the cave and never return
- Yeemik provided directions to Klarg's location deeper in the cave system

### The Flooded Passage
- The party crossed the bridge over the main cavern passage
- Goblins in the twin pools cave released a flood, attempting to wash the intruders away
- **Success**: Being on the bridge, the party avoided the rushing water entirely
- The goblins became aware of the party's presence in the cave system

### Battle at the Twin Pools Cave
- Three goblins rounded the corner as the party approached the pools cave
- **Fierce combat** ensued with devastating consequences
- **Critical moment**: Zurkt was reduced to 0 hit points and began making death saving throws

#### Zurkt's Miraculous Recovery
- Zurkt rolled a **natural 20** on his death saving throw (5% chance)
- This brought him back to consciousness with 1 hit point
- He immediately used **Lay on Hands** to heal himself further
- The party decided to retreat for recovery

### Strategic Retreat and Rest
- The party withdrew to the **kennel cave** (Area 3)
- Took a **short rest** to recuperate hit points and abilities
- Prepared for the final confrontation with Klarg

### The Final Battle - Klarg's Cave
**Tactical Approach:**
- **Xanorin** used **Wild Shape** to transform into a **giant spider**
- Climbed up the natural fissure for a surprise attack from above
- Positioned for an ambush on the ceiling

**Combat Highlights:**
- Xanorin attempted a surprise attack with spider fangs but **missed critically**
- **Dusty Crab** softened enemies with a devastating **breath weapon** attack
- **The Duke** entered a **rage** and delivered devastating blows to Klarg
- The Duke's final strike with his greataxe **virtually cut the bugbear in half**

**Enemies Defeated:**
- Klarg the bugbear (leader)
- Ripper the wolf (Klarg's companion)
- Two goblins

### Session Conclusion
- Zurkt claimed **Klarg's severed head** as proof for Yeemik
- The party stands victorious but battered
- Ready to return to Yeemik to complete their bargain and rescue Sildar
