## Standard Actions

A character can take **one** of these actions on their turn:

- **Attack**: Make weapon attacks (number based on character level/abilities)
- **Cast a Spell**: Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action
- **Dash**: Double your movement speed for the turn
- **Disengage**: Prevent opportunity attacks when you move
- **Dodge**: Impose disadvantage on attacks against you until your next turn
- **Help**: Give advantage to an ally's next ability check or attack
- **Hide**: Make a Stealth check to hide
- **Ready**: Prepare an action to trigger later (consumes your reaction)
- **Search**: Make a Perception or Investigation check
- **Use an Object**: Use an object that requires an action

## Bonus Actions

A character can take a bonus action only when:

- A special ability, spell, or feature states it uses a bonus action
- Examples include: off-hand attacks, certain spells (Healing Word, Misty Step), class features like Cunning Action

## Reactions

Available reactions (usable once between your turns):

- **Opportunity Attacks**: When an enemy leaves your reach
- **Readied Actions**: Using an action you prepared with the Ready action
- **Certain Spells**: Such as [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shield|shield]], [[counterspell|Counterspell]], or [[hellish-rebuke]]
- **Special Abilities**: Like a Fighter's Combat Superiority manoeuvres

## Common Action Economy Mistakes

- Confusing bonus actions with regular actions
- Taking multiple bonus actions in one turn
- Using multiple reactions in a single round
- Forgetting that movement can be split
- Attempting to take multiple regular actions without special abilities that allow it

## Tips for Dungeon Masters

- Track reactions that have been used (especially counterspells)
- Remind new players about bonus action limitations
- Consider using tokens to represent used reactions
- Be consistent with free object interactions
- Remember that communication is reasonably free**
