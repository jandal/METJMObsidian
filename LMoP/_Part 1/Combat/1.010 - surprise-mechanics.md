# Surprise Mechanics for the Goblin Ambush

## How Surprise Works in D&D 5e

The goblin ambush in Lost Mine of Phandelver presents a perfect opportunity to use the surprise mechanics. Let's break down how to handle this step by step.

### The Scenario

*"Four goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack."*

## Running the Surprise Encounter

### Step 1: Determine if Anyone Is Surprised
- The goblins are already hiding, so the party cannot surprise them
- The goblins might surprise some or all characters in the party

### Step 2: Make a Stealth Check for the Goblins
- Roll once for all goblins: `1d20 + 6` (their Stealth modifier)
- Compare this result to each character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score
- Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom modifier + any applicable bonuses
- Any character whose passive Perception is lower than the goblins' Stealth check result is surprised

### Step 3: Handle Surprise Consequences
- Surprised characters lose their turn during the first round of combat
- They can't take actions, bonus actions, or reactions until their first turn ends
- Being surprised is a condition that ends after a character's first turn

### Step 4: Roll Initiative Normally
- Everyone (including surprised characters) rolls initiative 
- Arrange all combatants in initiative order
- When a surprised character's turn comes up in the first round, they do nothing but their surprised condition ends after their turn passes

## Example Walkthrough

1. The goblins roll a Stealth check: `1d20+6 = 17`
2. Compare to each character's passive Perception:
   - Character A: Passive Perception 15 → Surprised
   - Character B: Passive Perception 18 → Not surprised
   - Character C: Passive Perception 12 → Surprised
   - Character D: Passive Perception 16 → Not surprised
3. Roll initiative for everyone (let's say the results are: Goblins 15, Character A 18, Character B 12, Character C 20, Character D 10)
4. Initiative order: Character C (20), Character A (18), Goblins (15), Character B (12), Character D (10)
5. First round actions:
   - Character C is surprised and skips their turn, but is no longer surprised afterward
   - Character A is surprised and skips their turn, but is no longer surprised afterward
   - Goblins take their turns normally 
   - Character B takes their turn normally (not surprised)
   - Character D takes their turn normally (not surprised)

## Important Rules Notes

- Surprise is determined before initiative is rolled
- A character can be surprised even if others in the party aren't
- After the first round, surprise is no longer relevant
- Characters who aren't surprised can use reactions from the start of combat
- Remember that characters with the Alert feat can never be surprised

## Goblin Tactics

The goblins in this encounter have a Stealth bonus of +6, making them quite sneaky. They will:
- Hide until characters approach the dead horses
- Use ranged attacks from hiding when possible
- Two goblins will rush forward for melee while two stay back with bows
- The last surviving goblin will flee toward the hideout when three are defeated
