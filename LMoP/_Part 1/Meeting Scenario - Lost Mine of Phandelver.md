## Setting the Scene: The Wayfarer's Rest

_Located on the outskirts of Neverwinter, the Wayfarer's Rest is a modest but well-kept tavern frequented by merchants, adventurers, and travellers of all sorts. The establishment is known for its hearty stew, locally brewed ale, and the proprietor's uncanny ability to connect people who might benefit from one another's skills._

## The Meeting Hook

### Gundren Rockseeker's Request

A dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker has been staying at the Wayfarer's Rest for the past few days, seeking capable individuals for an escort mission. He's been quite secretive about his business but has mentioned finding "something big" that could revitalise the region. He needs trustworthy individuals to transport supplies to Phandalin while he rides ahead with his warrior escort, Sildar Hallwinter.

## Character Introductions

### How Xanorin Gets Involved

Xanorin, the halfling druid with a spy background, has been keeping tabs on the region for their druid circle. There have been concerning reports of unnatural disturbances in the ecosystem around Phandalin, and the circle has tasked Xanorin with investigating. While gathering information at the Wayfarer's Rest, Xanorin overhears Gundren discussing his need for escorts to Phandalin—the perfect opportunity to travel to the area of interest without drawing attention.

**Scene**: _Xanorin sits quietly in the corner of the tavern, nursing a cup of herbal tea while discreetly observing Gundren's table. The druid's keen eyes miss nothing, including the dwarf's excitement when discussing his discovery with Sildar in hushed tones._

### How Dusty Crab Gets Involved

Dusty Crab, the dragonborn sorcerer with guild artisan connections, has been commissioned by their guild to investigate strange weather patterns and unusual storms near Phandalin. The guild has received reports that these phenomena might be related to long-lost magical artefacts from the region. Additionally, Dusty Crab's guild has business interests in Phandalin and wants to establish connections with local merchants.

**Scene**: _Dusty Crab enters the tavern with purpose, the dragonborn's scales gleaming in the firelight. Several patrons glance up nervously at the imposing figure, but the innkeeper welcomes them warmly. "The dwarf you're looking for is over there," the innkeeper says, nodding towards Gundren's table. "Heard he's hiring escorts to Phandalin—might be just what you're looking for."_

### How Zurkt Gets Involved

Zurkt, the thunder goblin paladin with a haunted past, has been experiencing visions of a great darkness emanating from the direction of Phandalin. These visions are connected to Zurkt's harrowing event from their backstory and have driven them to seek answers. Despite being a goblin (a race typically mistrusted in these parts), Zurkt's obvious divine calling and earnest demeanour have allowed them to travel relatively unmolested.

**Scene**: _The tavern door opens, and conversations momentarily cease as Zurkt enters. The goblin stands tall despite the suspicious glances, the divine symbol on their armour catching the light. Zurkt has followed their visions to this place and immediately recognises Gundren from a dream—this dwarf is somehow connected to whatever darkness threatens the region._

## The Meeting

As evening falls at the Wayfarer's Rest, Gundren Rockseeker becomes increasingly animated, discussing his plans with Sildar Hallwinter at a central table. Merrin Stonebridge, the innkeeper, wipes her hands thoughtfully on her apron as she observes the three potential adventurers who have separately shown interest in travelling to Phandalin. She approaches each of them discreetly.

To Xanorin, she leans down slightly: "See that dwarf over there, lambkin? 'E's 'iring trustworthy folk to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Payin' good coin too. Seems you're eadin' that way—might be safer with company, wouldn't it?" She taps the stump of her missing pinky against her thigh, adding quietly, "And someone with your... observant nature might be just what 'e needs."

To Dusty Crab, she straightens her posture respectfully: "That dwarf's lookin' for escorts to Phandalin, duck. Good pay for honest work, and I reckon someone with guild connections might find it worth their while. Your kind don't scare me none—met plenty of dragonborn in me travelin' days." She gives a hearty chuckle. "Besides, anyone who appreciates me blackberry mead 'as good taste in me book."

Approaching Zurkt with measured steps but without fear: "Now then, I don't often see your kind in these parts, but that symbol you wear speaks volumes. That dwarf yonder," she nods toward Gundren while wiping her hands on her apron, "needs good folk for a journey to Phandalin. Dangerous roads these days. Takes all sorts to make a proper company, don't it? I'd wager those visions of yours might be pointin' you that way for a reason." She gives a knowing wink.

To each, she concludes: "Want me to make introductions? Sometimes the right companions are more valuable than gold on the road—though the gold 'elps too!" Her warm laugh invites trust, even as her shrewd eyes take in every detail of their reactions.

### The Conversation

When the characters are brought together at Gundren's table:

1. **Gundren's Proposal**: "Ah, good folk! I'm in need of reliable hands to escort a wagon of mining supplies to Phandalin. My brothers and I have discovered something extraordinary—a lost mine of immense value! I must ride ahead with Sildar here, but the supplies are crucial for our operation. Deliver them to Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin, and there's 10 gold pieces for each of you."
2. **Character Motivations**: Each character can share as much or as little of their reason for travelling to Phandalin as they wish. This creates immediate mystery and potential for character development as the journey progresses.
3. **Forming the Party**: Despite potential reservations (particularly about travelling with a goblin, even one divinely blessed), the practical benefits of group travel—and Gundren's vouching for all present as worthy of trust—establishes the adventuring party.

## Departure

The next morning, the party meets at the eastern gate of Neverwinter. Gundren and Sildar are mounted and ready to depart.

"The wagon is loaded and ready," Gundren explains, patting a scroll case at his belt that presumably contains his precious map. "Stick to the High Road, then east on the Triboar Trail. Should take you about two days if the weather holds. We'll ride ahead and meet you in Phandalin."

With final instructions given and handshakes exchanged, Gundren and Sildar kick their horses into a trot and disappear down the road, leaving the newly formed party with their wagon and the beginning of what promises to be a significant adventure.

## DM Notes

### Character Integration Points

- **Xanorin's Spy Background**: The druid might notice signs of goblin activity before the ambush occurs, potentially giving the party an advantage.
- **Dusty Crab's Weather Sensitivity**: As a storm sorcerer, they might sense the unnatural stillness before the goblin ambush—nature holding its breath.
- **Zurkt's Unique Position**: When the party encounters goblins from the Cragmaw tribe, Zurkt's presence as a different type of goblin creates an interesting dynamic. The Cragmaws might be confused, hostile, or attempt to recruit Zurkt.

### Adjusting the Adventure

Given that you have three PCs rather than the four to five suggested by the module:

1. **Combat Balance**: Consider reducing the number of goblins in the initial ambush from four to three, or keeping all four but having one flee early to warn the hideout.
2. **NPC Support**: Sildar Hallwinter can become a temporary ally after rescue, helping to balance the party size.
3. **Level Adjustments**: Note that Zurkt is currently Level 1 while the others are Level 2. You might consider having Zurkt level up after the first encounter, or adjusting early encounters slightly to account for this disparity.
4. **Highlight Character Strengths**: Ensure early encounters allow each character to shine:
    - Wilderness areas for Xanorin's druid abilities
    - Social interactions for Dusty Crab's high Charisma
    - Combat opportunities for Zurkt's paladin capabilities

This meeting scenario provides a natural introduction to the adventure while respecting each character's established background and giving them personal motivation to be involved in the events of Lost Mine of Phandelver.
