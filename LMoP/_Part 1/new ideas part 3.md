# Cragmaw Cave Adaptation

## Current Situation Assessment

Based on your information, your party is halfway through the Cragmaw Hideout, and you've skipped the dramatic moment where Yeemik threatens to throw Sildar Hallwinter off the ledge. This changes the dynamic of the encounter and potentially affects how information about Gundren Rockseeker and the Black Spider is revealed to the players.

## Key Plot Points to Preserve

Despite this change, these essential plot elements still need to be conveyed to the players:

1. Gundren Rockseeker has been captured and taken to Cragmaw Castle
2. Gundren had a map showing the location of Wave Echo Cave
3. The Black Spider is behind the attack on Gundren
4. Sildar's connection to the Lords' Alliance and his search for Iarno Albrek

## Revised Goblin Den (Area 6)

### New Setup

Since you didn't have Yeemik threaten to throw Sildar off the ledge, here's an alternative approach:

**Sildar's Condition**: Sildar is still bound on the southern ledge, but perhaps he's more alert than in the original scenario. He's weakened (still at 1 hit point) but conscious enough to call out to the adventurers when they enter.

**Yeemik's Strategy**: Instead of using Sildar as a hostage in a desperate situation, Yeemik could try a different approach:

1. **Negotiation from Strength**: When the party enters, Yeemik stands proudly on the upper ledge with his goblins, assuming a position of authority. He's still interested in overthrowing Klarg but tries to appear more in control.
    
2. **Information Bargaining**: Yeemik reveals he has valuable information about Gundren Rockseeker that the party might want, suggesting a trade rather than a threat.
    
3. **Proposal**: "Kill Klarg for me, bring me his head, and I'll not only give you this human, but I'll tell you where they took the dwarf and his map." This maintains Yeemik's original motivation while changing the dynamics.
    

### Possible Outcomes

1. **If players agree to the deal**: They proceed to Area 8 to confront Klarg. When they return with proof of Klarg's defeat, Yeemik releases Sildar but tries to negotiate for more payment before revealing information about Gundren.
    
2. **If players refuse and attack**: The fight proceeds normally, and they can rescue Sildar, who provides the information about Gundren, the map, and the Black Spider as written in the adventure.
    
3. **If players try diplomacy**: Allow a Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Yeemik to release Sildar. Set the DC based on what the players offer in return—gold, sparing Yeemik's life, etc. A successful check might result in Yeemik revealing some information about Gundren while keeping other details as leverage.
    

## Sildar's Role

Without the dramatic rescue from being thrown off a ledge, Sildar's gratitude might be lessened slightly. Consider these adjustments:

1. **Condition**: Sildar is still badly beaten and needs assistance. This allows the party to establish a bond by healing him.
    
2. **Gratitude**: While grateful for the rescue, his offer of 50gp for escort to Phandalin might be presented more as a business arrangement than pure gratitude.
    
3. **Information Sharing**: Have Sildar reveal information about Gundren, the Black Spider, the map, and his mission regarding Iarno Albrek gradually during the journey to Phandalin rather than all at once in the hideout.
    

## Klarg's Encounter (Area 8)

Keep this encounter largely as written. If the players agreed to kill Klarg for Yeemik, they might approach this differently—perhaps trying stealth or creating a distraction rather than a frontal assault.

If the players have struck a deal with Yeemik, Klarg might somehow learn of this betrayal, adding an interesting element to the encounter:

- Klarg could taunt the players about being "Yeemik's puppets"
- He might offer a counter-deal: kill Yeemik instead and take control of the hideout for themselves
- This creates a moral dilemma for more good-aligned parties

## Post-Hideout Developments

Once the party clears the hideout, they'll likely head to Phandalin with Sildar. Consider these adjustments:

1. **Journey Conversations**: Use the travel time for Sildar to share background information about the Rockseeker brothers, the lost mine, and his concerns about Iarno's disappearance.
    
2. **Arrival in Phandalin**: If the players didn't get full information from the hideout, have Elmar Barthen at Barthen's Provisions fill in some gaps about Gundren's excitement regarding his discovery.
    
3. **Adventure Hooks**: Use Sildar to more strongly emphasize the potential hooks in Phandalin, such as investigating the Redbrand threat or searching for Cragmaw Castle.
    

## Transition to Phandalin

To ensure a smooth transition from the hideout to Phandalin:

1. During travel, emphasize that the town is a frontier settlement with opportunity and danger in equal measure.
    
2. Have Sildar mention specific NPCs the players should seek out in Phandalin:
    
    - Elmar Barthen (to deliver supplies and get paid)
    - Linene Graywind (to return Lionshield supplies if recovered)
    - Halia Thornton (who might know more about regional threats)
    - Townmaster Harbin Wester (for official business)
3. Plant seeds about the Redbrands being a problem in town, setting up that storyline.
    

## Experience and Rewards

Keep the XP rewards as written: 275 XP per character for clearing the hideout and defeating Klarg. This should still allow them to reach level 2 before arriving in Phandalin.

## Returning with Klarg's Proof

Since the party has already negotiated and killed Klarg, they return to claim their end of the bargain:

### Yeemik's Reaction to Klarg's Death

> [!readaloud] As you approach the goblin den with proof of Klarg's demise, Yeemik's eyes widen with a mixture of glee and disbelief. "You... you actually did it!" he shrieks, bouncing excitedly on the ledge. "Klarg is dead! Yeemik is now the boss!" His celebration is wild and manic.

**What Yeemik Accepts as Proof:**

- Klarg's head (most convincing)
- Klarg's weapons or distinctive items
- Detailed description of Klarg's defeat
- Klarg's treasure (if they mention finding it)

### The Exchange

> [!readaloud] Still clutching the bound human, Yeemik cackles with triumph. "A deal is a deal! Yeemik keeps his word - not like stupid Klarg!" He roughly shoves the prisoner towards the edge. "But Yeemik is generous! You go now, leave Yeemik's territory, and maybe we no fight again, yes?"

---

### Potential Complications with Yeemik

Despite the deal, there are still risks:

**Trust Issues:**

- **Insight Check (DC 12)** reveals Yeemik is nervous about letting them go
- He's worried they might return to finish him off
- The other goblins look uncertain about their new "leader"

**Possible Betrayal Attempts:**

1. **Demand Additional Payment:** "Actually, killing Klarg was easy part! Now Yeemik needs... insurance money!"
2. **Partial Release:** Frees Sildar but demands the party leave weapons behind
3. **Information Ransom:** "Yeemik knows where dwarf friend went... for right price"

### How to Handle Yeemik's Release

Give the party options for ensuring he keeps his word:

**Intimidation Approach:**

- **DC 13 Intimidation:** Yeemik nervously complies immediately
- **Failure:** He tries to negotiate further or stall

**Persuasion Approach:**

- **DC 11 Persuasion:** Appeal to his desire to be seen as trustworthy leader
- **Success:** "Yes, yes! Yeemik is honourable goblin boss!"

**Show of Force:**

- Demonstrate magical abilities or combat prowess
- Yeemik quickly releases Sildar without further argument

**Direct Action:**

- If the party simply demands Sildar's release, Yeemik reluctantly complies
- He's too excited about his new status to risk immediate conflict

---

### The Actual Release

> [!readaloud] With surprising care for a goblin, Yeemik cuts Sildar's bonds and helps the wounded human to his feet. "There! Deal complete!" he announces proudly to his subordinates. "Yeemik keeps word! Now you go, before Yeemik changes mind about being generous!"

**Sildar's Condition During Release:**

- Stumbles but remains conscious (barely)
- Needs support to stand properly
- Looks relieved but wary of further goblin tricks
- Grateful eyes fixed on his rescuers

### Yeemik's Final Words

Choose based on how the negotiation went:

**If the party was respectful:**

> "You fought well against Klarg! Yeemik respects strong warriors. Maybe we meet again when Yeemik rules all goblins in wood!"

**If the party was threatening:**

> "Yeemik remembers faces. You stay away from Yeemik's caves, and Yeemik stays away from your roads. Fair?"

**If the party seemed interested in information:**

> "Yeemik knows many things about roads, about dwarf friend, about Black Spider... but that is different business for different day!"

### Initial Dialogue

Once stable and conscious:

> [!readaloud] "My... my thanks," Sildar croaks, his voice hoarse from thirst and injury. "I am Sildar Hallwinter of the Lords' Alliance. Those accursed goblins... they took Gundren... and the map..." He pauses, gathering strength. "Tell me, brave souls, how came you to this forsaken place?"

---

## Information Exchange

### What Sildar Knows

After brief introductions, Sildar can share:

1. **Gundren's Fate:**
    
    - Captured along with Sildar on the road
    - Taken to "Cragmaw Castle" by Klarg's orders
    - Had a map showing the location of "Wave Echo Cave"
2. **The Black Spider:**
    
    - Mysterious figure giving orders to the Cragmaws to waylay Gundren
    - Specifically wanted Gundren captured, not killed
    - Sildar doesn't know the Black Spider's identity
3. **His Mission:**
    
    - Travelling to Phandalin to find Iarno Albrek
    - Fellow Lords' Alliance member, missing for two months
    - Sent to establish order in Phandalin
4. **Immediate Concerns:**
    
    - Urgent need to reach Phandalin
    - Willing to pay 50 gp for escort
    - Wants to organise search for Gundren

### Roleplaying Sildar

- **Grateful but professional** - thanks the party sincerely
- **Duty-focused** - concerned about his mission and Gundren's fate
- **Respectful of the party's capabilities** - recognises their skill
- **Pragmatic** - understands the dangers ahead

---

## Wrapping Up the Hideout

### Treasure and Supplies

From the document, the party should find:

- **Klarg's treasure chest:** 600 cp, 110 sp, 2 potions of healing, jade frog statuette (40 gp)
- **Stolen supplies:** Lionshield Coster goods (reward of 50 gp if returned)
- **Yeemik's possessions:** 3 gold teeth (1 gp each), 15 sp

### Experience Points

- **Story Milestone:** 275 XP per character for completing the hideout
- **Individual encounters:** Standard XP for creatures defeated
- **Bonus XP:** Consider awarding extra for clever solutions or excellent roleplay

### Next Steps

The party should have multiple motivations to visit Phandalin:

1. **Escort Sildar** (50 gp payment)
2. **Deliver supplies** (if they have the wagon)
3. **Report to Barthen's Provisions** (complete original job)
4. **Investigate Gundren's disappearance**
5. **Return stolen goods** to Lionshield Coster

---

## Potential Complications

### If Sildar Dies

- **Yeemik becomes more confident** and demands tribute
- **Information must come from other sources** (captured goblins, written notes)
- **Lords' Alliance involvement** becomes more mysterious
- **Party loses potential ally** and payment

### If Yeemik Escapes

- **Future complications** in Phandalin or surrounding areas
- **Potential ambush** on the road
- **Information reaches other Cragmaw groups**

### If Party Chooses Violence Over Negotiation

- **Higher chance of Sildar being injured** or killed
- **Missed opportunity** for information gathering
- **Potential guilt** if rescue goes poorly

---

## Session Transition

End the session with:

1. **Sildar's grateful thanks** and offer of employment
2. **Clear path forward** to Phandalin
3. **Sense of accomplishment** for the completed hideout
4. **Anticipation** for the next phase of the adventure

Consider ending on Sildar's words:

> "You've saved my life and struck a blow against these raiders. But I fear this is only the beginning. Gundren is still in danger, and dark forces are stirring in these lands. Will you help me see justice done?"
