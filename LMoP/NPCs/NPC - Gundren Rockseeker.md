### Background

Gundren is the middle of the three Rockseeker brothers, born to a respectable clan of mining dwarves from the mountains north of Neverwinter. Always more interested in finding treasures than the patient work of extracting ore, Gundren spent his youth exploring old mines and delving into forgotten tunnels.

Thirty years ago, a disastrous cave-in killed the brothers' parents and several other clan members. This tragedy drove the brothers to seek their fortunes elsewhere, with Gundren becoming increasingly obsessed with the legends of lost mines and forgotten wealth.

For the past decade, Gundren has devoted himself to researching the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave, convinced that the ancient site of the Phandelver's Pact contained wealth and magic that would make the Rockseekers rich beyond imagining. After countless false leads and disappointments, he and his brothers finally discovered evidence of the mine's entrance.

### Connections & Motivations

- **Brothers:** Works closely with Tharden and Nundro, with Tharden handling historical research and Nundro managing practical mining operations
- **Friendship with Sildar:** Developed a friendship with Sildar Hallwinter during previous business in Neverwinter, hiring him as escort
- **Connection to Merrin:** Has frequented The Wayfarer's Rest for years, trusting Merrin's discretion with his plans
- **Business Associate:** Has an arrangement with Elmar Barthen in Phandalin to provide supplies for the mining operation

### Secrets

- The map to Wave Echo Cave is incomplete—they've found the entrance but not all the hazards within
- Gundren knows more about the magical properties of the Forge of Spells than he lets on
- He's already spent much of the family's remaining wealth on this venture—failure is not an option
- He's secretly afraid of the dark but would never admit this dwarven failing to anyone

### Roleplaying Tips

- Gundren alternates between exuberant enthusiasm and paranoid secrecy
- He genuinely believes the mine will change everyone's fortunes
- While not traditionally educated, he has extensive practical knowledge of mining, geography, and dwarven history
- Despite his gruff exterior, he forms quick bonds with those who earn his trust
