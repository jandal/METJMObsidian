## Background

Merrin wasn't always an innkeeper. In her youth, she travelled widely as a quartermaster for a mercenary company called the Silver Banners. During those years, she learned the value of good information, reliable allies, and when to speak and when to listen.

The missing pinky is from an encounter with a particularly nasty tax collector in Luskan who didn't appreciate her company's refusal to pay "protection money." She left that profession after her company walked into an ambush that she should have seen coming. Only she and three others survived.

With her savings, she purchased The Wayfarer's Rest fifteen years ago. Since then, she's transformed it from a rundown roadhouse to a respectable establishment known for its neutrality, discretion, and Merrin's uncanny ability to connect people who might help each other.

## Connections & Secrets

- **Secret Network:** Merrin maintains a loose network of former adventurers, merchants, and travellers who keep her informed about happenings throughout the Sword Coast.
- **Gundren Connection:** She and Gundren Rockseeker go back many years. She knows more about his "big discovery" than she lets on but respects his secrecy.
- **Lords' Alliance:** She occasionally passes information to Sildar Hallwinter and the Lords' Alliance when she learns of threats to settled lands.
- **Hidden Room:** The inn has a concealed cellar room where those in genuine need can hide out temporarily.
- **Dark Secret:** The ambush that killed most of her mercenary company wasn't entirely unexpectedâ€”she had heard rumours but dismissed them as competitors trying to scare them off a lucrative job.

## The Wayfarer's Rest Features

- A sturdy two-storey building with a slate roof and thick stone walls
- Main taproom with a large hearth, six tables, and a polished bar made from a single massive oak
- Five rooms for rent upstairs, each named after a different region of the Sword Coast
- A small herb garden out back where Merrin grows seasoning for her famous stew
- A stable large enough for six horses, tended by a mute half-elf named Thorn
- Known for three specialities: Merrin's Hearty Traveller's Stew, Blackberry Mead, and fresh-baked Hearth Bread

## Using Merrin in Your Campaign

### As an Information Source

Merrin knows much of what happens along the High Road and Triboar Trail. She might share concerns about increased goblin activity or strange happenings around Phandalin if properly approached.

### As a Quest Giver

Beyond introducing the party to Gundren, Merrin might occasionally send messages to the party about other opportunities she's heard about, particularly if they frequent her establishment and gain her trust.

### As a Safe Haven

If the party runs into trouble, The Wayfarer's Rest can serve as a neutral ground where they can recover and plan their next move. Merrin protects those under her roof.

### As a Plot Hook

Merrin's connections to her former mercenary life might resurface, possibly creating complications or opportunities for the party. Perhaps an old enemy comes looking for her, or a former comrade needs help.

## Character Hooks for Your PCs

- **For Xanorin (Halfling Druid/Spy):** Merrin recognises something in Xanorin's careful observations and might subtly indicate she knows they're more than just a curious halfling. She could become a valuable contact for Xanorin's spy network.
    
- **For Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer):** Having travelled widely, Merrin has encountered dragonborn before and treats Dusty Crab with respectful normalcy rather than the stares they might get elsewhere. She might have connections to artisan guilds that could interest Dusty.
    
- **For Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin):** While initially cautious around Zurkt, Merrin judges people by their actions rather than their race. She might be one of the few people who treats Zurkt with immediate respect, recognising the divine calling that sets them apart.
    

## Roleplaying Tips

- Merrin listens more than she speaks
- She rarely gives direct advice, preferring to guide through questions
- While generally kind, she can be stern when her establishment's rules are broken
- She has little patience for bullies or those who threaten the vulnerable
- Her stew recipe is a closely guarded secret that she refuses to share
- Despite her warmth, there's a sadness about her when she thinks no one is watching
