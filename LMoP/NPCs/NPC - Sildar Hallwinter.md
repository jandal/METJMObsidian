## Background

Sildar Hallwinter was born to a merchant family in Waterdeep but showed more interest in swordplay than shipments from an early age. He joined the City Watch in his youth before being selected for the more prestigious Griffin Cavalry, where he served with distinction for nearly two decades.

After rising to the rank of captain, Sildar was approached by the Lords' Alliance—a coalition of political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Recognising the value of his experience and judgment, they recruited him for special assignments outside Waterdeep's walls.

Now in the autumn of his career, Sildar serves as a troubleshooter for the Alliance, investigating threats to settled lands and assessing potential new members for the organisation. His current assignment involves checking on his fellow agent Iarno Albrek, who was sent to the frontier town of Phandalin to establish order but has mysteriously gone silent.

## Connections & Motivations

- **Lords' Alliance:** Serves the coalition with steadfast loyalty, reporting to Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter
- **Iarno Albrek:** Concerned about the disappearance of his fellow agent in Phandalin
- **Gundren Rockseeker:** Views the dwarf's discovery as potentially valuable for regional prosperity
- **Townmaster Harbin Wester:** Has reservations about the townmaster's leadership abilities
- **Halia Thornton:** Aware of her connections to the Zhentarim and wary of their influence

## Secrets

- Sildar knows more about the political significance of Wave Echo Cave than he initially reveals
- He suspects (but cannot prove) that someone within the Lords' Alliance leaked information about Gundren's discovery
- Has previous history with the Black Spider from an unrelated investigation years ago
- Carries a encoded message from Lord Neverember intended for Iarno that he hasn't shared with anyone

## Roleplaying Sildar

### When First Encountered

When the party first encounters Sildar in the Cragmaw Hideout, he is badly beaten and at only 1 hit point. Despite his weakened state, he maintains his dignity and is immediately concerned with:

1. The safety of Gundren Rockseeker
2. The whereabouts of the map to Wave Echo Cave
3. Expressing gratitude to his rescuers without seeming helpless

**Sample Dialogue:** _"My thanks for the timely rescue. I am Sildar Hallwinter, in service to the Lords' Alliance. The goblins have taken Gundren elsewhere—Cragmaw Castle, I believe they called it. We must find him with all haste... not only for his safety but because he carries something of great value. A map to a lost mine that could bring prosperity back to these lands."_

### As a Travelling Companion

If Sildar accompanies the party to Phandalin, he serves as:

1. A source of information about the Lords' Alliance and regional politics
2. A mentor figure who can offer tactical advice in combat
3. A moderating influence when the party faces ethical dilemmas
4. A quest-giver regarding the search for Iarno Albrek

**Sample Dialogue:** _"The road ahead may be watch for any movement in those trees. Goblin scouts often... yes, there. Did you see it? A flash of green. Keep your weapons ready but not drawn—we don't want to appear aggressive to any legitimate travellers we might encounter."_

### In Phandalin

Once in Phandalin, Sildar establishes himself as a representative of order and civilisation. His priorities shift to:

1. Investigating Iarno's disappearance
2. Gathering information about the Redbrands
3. Supporting legitimate governance in the frontier town
4. Maintaining contact with the party about Gundren's rescue

**Sample Dialogue:** _"This town needs order if it's to survive, let alone prosper. The Redbrands' lawlessness must be addressed, but I fear there's something more sinister at work here. If you learn anything about a wizard named Iarno Albrek, bring that information to me immediately. He's... a colleague, and his silence is most concerning."_

### Character Development

As the adventure progresses, consider these developments for Sildar:

1. His respect for the party grows as they prove themselves
2. He reveals more about his suspicions regarding infiltration of the Lords' Alliance
3. He may struggle with his loyalties if evidence implicates Iarno in wrongdoing
4. He becomes increasingly invested in the prosperity of Phandalin, perhaps considering settling there

## Using Sildar in Your Campaign

### As a Combat Ally

Sildar is an experienced warrior who can provide valuable support in combat, but should never overshadow the party. Consider these approaches:

1. Have him focus on defensive manoeuvres and supporting actions
2. Use his Leadership ability to boost party members at crucial moments
3. Position him to protect vulnerable NPCs or secure escape routes
4. If combat becomes too easy with his help, have him assign himself a different tactical objective

### As an Information Source

Sildar knows a great deal about:

1. The political landscape of the Sword Coast
2. Military history and strategy
3. The Lords' Alliance and its goals
4. Threats to civilisation in the region

However, his knowledge has limits, and there are some topics he avoids discussing due to his oaths of secrecy.

### As a Quest Giver

Sildar can provide the following quest hooks:

1. Finding Cragmaw Castle and rescuing Gundren
2. Investigating the Redbrands and their connection to the Black Spider
3. Locating Iarno Albrek
4. Establishing communication with other Lords' Alliance outposts
5. Securing Wave Echo Cave for legitimate mining operations

### As a Moral Compass

Though not preachy, Sildar represents civilised values and can serve as a barometer for the moral implications of the party's actions:

1. He approves of efforts to bring law and order to the frontier
2. He values mercy but understands that some threats must be eliminated
3. He disapproves of theft, torture, or cruelty
4. He respects local customs and authorities unless they directly threaten the common good

## Adaptation for Your Campaign

Sildar is designed to be a versatile NPC who can fill multiple roles in your campaign beyond the scope of Lost Mine of Phandelver:

1. If the party continues to higher levels, he might recruit them for Lords' Alliance missions
2. He could become the official representative of Neverwinter in a rebuilt Phandalin
3. His past connections could provide hooks for urban adventures in Waterdeep
4. His mentorship could be particularly meaningful for martial characters looking for guidance

## Notes for Character Connections

### Connection to Xanorin (Halfling Druid/Spy)

Sildar's background in espionage and service to the Lords' Alliance gives him a natural connection to Xanorin. He might recognise the hallmarks of a fellow agent, though he would be discreet about acknowledging this. Consider having Sildar occasionally seek private conversations with Xanorin, creating opportunities for sharing intelligence without the knowledge of the rest of the party.

### Connection to Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer)

Sildar has encountered dragonborn during his service in Waterdeep and treats them with respect rather than suspicion. He might be particularly interested in Dusty Crab's storm sorcery, drawing parallels to magical abilities he's observed in the Griffin Cavalry. His connections to the guilds of Waterdeep could also prove useful to a character with a Guild Artisan background.

### Connection to Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin)

Initially, Sildar will be extremely wary of Zurkt, given his recent captivity at the hands of goblins. This creates excellent roleplaying opportunities as he struggles to reconcile his prejudice with Zurkt's obvious divine calling and honourable behaviour. Over time, this could evolve into a powerful narrative of overcoming bias, with Sildar eventually becoming one of Zurkt's strongest advocates when facing the prejudice of others.
