# Saving Throw Challenges - Test Weakest Save


## Design Philosophy

Each character faces 3 tailored challenges that test their **weakest saving throws** whilst creating memorable roleplay moments. These encounters are designed to challenge the party without being lethal, building tension during overland travel.

---

## Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer)

**Saving Throw Profile:** STR +0, DEX +2, CON +3, INT +3, WIS +1, CHA +6 **Weaknesses:** Strength and Wisdom

### Challenge 1: The Clinging Bog (Strength Save)

**Trigger:** Whilst crossing a seemingly innocuous stretch of marshy ground near a stream.

**Description:** The ground suddenly gives way beneath Dusty Crab's feet. What appeared to be solid earth is actually a layer of moss over deep, clinging mud that acts like quicksand.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 13 Strength saving throw**
- **Failure:** Dusty becomes restrained in the mud, sinking up to their waist. They must use their action each turn to attempt a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to escape, or allies can pull them out with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Success:** Dusty manages to distribute their weight and scramble to solid ground, though their robes are thoroughly muddied.
- **Consequences if trapped:** Each round trapped, Dusty sinks 6 inches deeper. After 3 rounds, they're chest-deep and have disadvantage on the escape attempts. This creates urgency without immediate lethality.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Does Dusty panic? Do they try to use magic creatively (Mage Hand to grab a branch)? How do the other party members react?

---

### Challenge 2: The Whispering Wind (Wisdom Save)

**Trigger:** As the party camps for the night in a hollow beneath ancient pine trees.

**Description:** A strange, keening wind begins to blow through the camp. It carries whispers in Primordial (which Dusty understands due to Wind Speaker) that speak of failures, inadequacies, and the futility of their quest. The whispers seem to know about Dusty's flaw of never being satisfied and their secret theft from the guild.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw**
- **Failure:** Dusty Crab becomes frightened for 1 minute. Whilst frightened, they're convinced their companions see them as a fraud and are quietly judging them. They can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.
- **Success:** Dusty recognises the magical nature of the whispers and can steel their mind against them, though they still hear the unsettling words.
- **Additional Effect:** Regardless of save result, Dusty is the only one who understands the Primordial words clearly. Others hear only wind and vague whispers.

**Source:** This is residual wild magic from the devastation of Mount Hotenow, interacting with Dusty's draconic bloodline.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Does Dusty share what they heard? How do they deal with their fears being voiced? Do they trust their companions enough to show vulnerability?

---

### Challenge 3: The Treacherous Scree (Strength or Dexterity Save - Player's Choice)

**Trigger:** Whilst navigating a steep hillside shortcut to save time.

**Description:** The party climbs a slope covered in loose stones. Without warning, Dusty's footing gives way and a small avalanche of rocks begins to slide beneath them, threatening to send them tumbling down the 20-foot slope.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 13 Strength OR Dexterity saving throw** (player chooses which to use)
- **Failure (Strength):** Dusty lacks the raw power to stop their slide and tumbles down the slope, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone at the bottom. They must spend half their movement to stand up.
- **Failure (Dexterity):** Dusty can't react quickly enough to find stable footing and slides down uncontrollably, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone 15 feet down the slope.
- **Success (Strength):** Dusty plants their feet and muscles through the shifting stones, maintaining their position through sheer determination.
- **Success (Dexterity):** Dusty nimbly picks their way across the sliding scree, using Tempestuous Magic instinctively to give them a brief moment of stability.

**Tactical Note:** If Dusty fails, the party must decide whether to continue up the slope carefully or descend to help them.

---

## The Duke (Human Barbarian - Totem of the Bear)

**Saving Throw Profile:** STR +4, DEX +2, CON +4, INT +0, WIS -1, CHA +0 **Weaknesses:** Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

### Challenge 1: The Illusory Path (Intelligence Save)

**Trigger:** Whilst navigating through a section of Neverwinter Wood where reality feels... thin.

**Description:** The path ahead splits into three directions. Each looks equally well-travelled, but something about this place feels wrong. Magical residue from the Mount Hotenow eruption has created an illusory path that leads in circles.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check** to notice the illusion, OR **DC 15 Intelligence saving throw** if they commit to a path
- **Failure:** The Duke leads the party down the illusory path. After 30 minutes of travel, they realise they're back where they started, having lost time and morale. Roll for a wilderness encounter with disadvantage on surprise checks due to disorientation.
- **Success:** The Duke's soldier training helps them notice that all three paths have identical scratches on trees at the same height—impossible in nature. They identify the real path.
- **Partial Success (10-12 on Investigation):** The Duke feels something is wrong but can't pinpoint what. Another party member can assist.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Does The Duke trust their instincts? Do they consult the map? How do they react to being fooled by magic?

---

### Challenge 2: The Ancient Guardian's Demand (Wisdom Save)

**Trigger:** The party encounters a massive, ancient oak tree that blocks their path. It radiates an aura of primal power.

**Description:** As The Duke approaches, the tree's face appears in the bark, and a deep voice speaks directly into their mind: "Why do you trespass in my domain, warrior? Your kind brings only destruction." The weight of countless years of wisdom presses down on The Duke's consciousness.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw**
- **Failure:** The Duke is overwhelmed by the guardian's presence and must answer three questions truthfully. The spirit is testing the party's intentions. Questions include: "What violence have you committed recently?" "What destruction will you bring to these lands?" "Do you value nature, or merely use it?"
- **Success:** The Duke maintains mental autonomy and can choose to answer diplomatically or refuse to answer, though the latter may anger the guardian.
- **Resolution:** If answers are respectful or show genuine care for protecting the innocent, the guardian allows passage and even provides advantage on the next Wisdom (Survival) check to find their destination. If answers show only self-interest, the party must take a longer route around the tree's territory (losing 4 hours).

**Note:** This is related to Reidoth's Emerald Enclave influence in the area—the guardian respects druids and those who respect nature.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** The Duke served in the military and left after disagreeing with orders. How does this experience shape their answers? How do they balance honesty with diplomacy?

---

### Challenge 3: The Charm of the Fey (Charisma Save)

**Trigger:** Whilst resting near a particularly beautiful glen with a crystal-clear stream.

**Description:** A pixie appears, invisible at first (DC 15 Wisdom Perception to spot). It's been watching the party and becomes particularly interested in The Duke's military insignia and trophy from a fallen enemy. The pixie uses its magic to try to charm The Duke into giving away these items "just for a little while" to "play soldiers."

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 12 Charisma saving throw** against the pixie's charm effect
- **Failure:** The Duke is charmed for 1 hour and believes the pixie is a delightful friend who just wants to borrow these items temporarily. The Duke willingly hands over their insignia of rank and trophy. When the charm ends, these items are nowhere to be found (though they can be recovered with roleplaying and clever thinking).
- **Success:** The Duke resists the charm and recognises the magical compulsion. The pixie becomes visible, pouts dramatically, then offers a trade instead: information about safe paths through the forest in exchange for a good story about The Duke's military service.

**Alternative Resolution:** If charmed, party members can attempt DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) checks to convince the pixie to return the items, or they can try to catch it (very difficult—pixies can turn invisible as a bonus action).

**Roleplay Opportunity:** How does The Duke react to being magically manipulated? Does their Chaotic Good alignment make them sympathetic to the mischievous fey? How do they feel about their prized possessions being taken?

---

## Xanorin (Lightfoot Halfling Druid - Circle of the Moon)

**Saving Throw Profile:** STR -1, DEX +1, CON +0, INT +2, WIS +5, CHA +0 **Weaknesses:** Strength, Constitution, and Charisma

### Challenge 1: The Crushing Deadfall (Strength Save)

**Trigger:** Whilst investigating the remains of an old trapper's cabin in the woods.

**Description:** The cabin's roof beam, weakened by decades of rot, finally gives way just as Xanorin stands beneath it. A heavy wooden beam comes crashing down directly toward them.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Strength saving throw**
- **Failure:** Xanorin is struck by the beam and pinned beneath it, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and becoming restrained. They must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to free themselves, or allies can lift the beam with a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Success:** Xanorin manages to push the beam aside as it falls, deflecting it enough to avoid being pinned. They still take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from glancing impact.
- **Critical Consideration:** Xanorin currently has only 15 HP out of 21, so this could be genuinely dangerous.

**Druid Option:** If Xanorin uses Wild Shape as a reaction (creative thinking), allow them advantage on the save as they transform into a small creature that can slip away, or a strong creature that can better handle the impact.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Does Xanorin panic, or do they remain calm? How do they react to being physically overpowered by something as simple as a falling beam?

---

### Challenge 2: The Toxic Spores (Constitution Save)

**Trigger:** The party passes through a shaded ravine where the air feels thick and heavy.

**Description:** Unseen until too late, the party has walked through a patch of mature Russet Mould (a fungal growth affected by the magical devastation). When disturbed, it releases a cloud of spores. Xanorin, being shorter than the others, gets the worst of it as the spores sink to ground level.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 13 Constitution saving throw**
- **Failure:** Xanorin inhales the spores and becomes poisoned for 1 hour. Whilst poisoned, they have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Additionally, they suffer fits of coughing that prevent them from maintaining concentration on spells.
- **Success:** Xanorin covers their mouth and nose in time, suffering only minor irritation (disadvantage on next Constitution check within 1 hour).
- **Additional Effect:** If Xanorin is in Wild Shape when this occurs, the animal form takes the effect, but the duration is reduced to 10 minutes due to the different physiology.

**Cure:** Lesser restoration, a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check with a healer's kit, or Xanorin can use Goodberry on themselves (each berry eaten reduces the duration by 10 minutes).

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Xanorin has proficiency in Stealth and is used to being sneaky—do they feel frustrated at being caught out? How do they cope with being unable to use their spellcasting effectively?

---

### Challenge 3: The Desperate Merchant (Charisma Save)

**Trigger:** The party encounters a merchant whose cart has broken down on the trail. He's clearly distressed.

**Description:** The merchant, whose name is Edric, begs the party for help. His daughter is sick in Phandalin, and he's carrying medicine from Neverwinter. His cart wheel broke, and he's convinced he'll lose valuable time if he doesn't reach her tonight. He's particularly focused on Xanorin, sensing druidic magic, and desperately pleads for magical healing.

**The Catch:** This is actually a test of character. Edric's daughter exists and is mildly ill (a bad cold), but she's not in danger. Edric is a con artist who uses sympathy to extract free magical services, gold, or supplies from travellers. He's very convincing—he'll show a painted portrait of a sweet young girl (stolen), shed real tears (he's practised), and offer a "future reward" that will never materialise.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 15 Charisma (Insight) check** to sense something is off about his story
- If they help without checking: Roll **DC 13 Charisma saving throw** when Edric makes his most emotional appeal ("Please, she's all I have left after her mother died!")
- **Failure:** Xanorin is moved by the plea and feels compelled to use a spell slot to cast Cure Wounds or give up valuable supplies (rations, healing potions, or gold).
- **Success:** Xanorin sympathises but doesn't feel magically compelled. They can choose to help on their own terms.
- **If Investigation Occurs:** A DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals his story has inconsistencies. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check of his cart reveals it's deliberately damaged (axle pin removed, not broken) and the "medicine" is coloured water.

**Resolution Options:**

1. Help unconditionally (lose resources but maintain Good alignment)
2. Help conditionally ("We'll fix your cart, but we're not giving you gold")
3. Expose the con (Edric flees, dropping the portrait)
4. Turn him in to the next settlement

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Xanorin has the Spy background and proficiency in Deception—do they recognise a fellow deceiver? How does their Neutral Good alignment guide them? Do they feel sympathy even for a con artist? Does their own history of deception make them more or less sympathetic?

## Zurkt (Thunder Goblin Paladin - Oath of Vengeance)

**Saving Throw Profile:** STR +3, DEX +1, CON +3, INT -1, WIS +2, CHA +1 **Weaknesses:** Intelligence, Dexterity, and Charisma

### Challenge 1: The Arcane Puzzle Lock (Intelligence Save)

**Trigger:** The party discovers an abandoned waystation that appears to have supplies inside, but the door is sealed with a magical lock.

**Description:** The door bears a glowing runic pattern. Above it is inscribed: "Speak the word of binding, or remain unbound forever." This is a simple arcane puzzle—the word is literally "binding" in Common—but it requires recognising the wordplay.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check** to understand the magical lock mechanism, OR **DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check** to work out the wordplay
- **Failure:** If Zurkt attempts to force the door or speaks the wrong word, trigger a magical effect: **DC 14 Intelligence saving throw**
    - **Save Failure:** Zurkt takes 2d8 psychic damage as overwhelming magical information floods their mind, leaving them stunned until the end of their next turn. They gain one level of exhaustion from the mental strain.
    - **Save Success:** Zurkt takes half damage and isn't stunned, but suffers a splitting headache (disadvantage on Intelligence checks for 1 hour).
- **Success on Initial Check:** Zurkt or an ally solves the puzzle, and the door opens harmlessly.

**Alternative Solution:** Another party member can attempt the puzzle. Zurkt's low Intelligence makes this genuinely challenging for them personally.

**Inside the Waystation:** If opened, it contains 3 days of rations, a tattered map showing local landmarks (advantage on next Survival check), and a rusted but serviceable dagger.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Zurkt's Intelligence is their clear dump stat. How do they react to being outwitted by a door? Do they feel frustrated? Do they ask for help or try to solve it through force? How does their Haunted One background affect their patience with puzzles?

---

### Challenge 2: The Collapsing Bridge (Dexterity Save)

**Trigger:** The party needs to cross a rope bridge over a ravine. The bridge is old and unstable.

**Description:** The rope bridge sways alarmingly in the wind. It's 30 feet long and spans a 40-foot deep ravine with a rocky stream below. As Zurkt crosses (likely first, being the tank), the rotten ropes begin to snap.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** when halfway across
- **Failure:** Zurkt falls through the breaking planks but manages to grab a rope. They're now dangling 40 feet above the rocks, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage from slamming into the ravine wall. They must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to climb back up, or allies can pull them up with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If they fall completely, they take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and land in 3 feet of cold water.
- **Success:** Zurkt reacts quickly enough to leap to a more stable section of the bridge, though the bridge is now clearly unsafe for the rest of the party. They must find another way across or attempt dangerous crossings.

**Complication:** Zurkt is wearing chain mail, which means:

- Disadvantage on the Dexterity save
- If they fall into the water, they must remove the armour (taking 5 minutes) or make DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to swim

**Alternative Solutions:**

- Use ropes to create a safer crossing
- Xanorin could Wild Shape into a Giant Eagle and ferry people across (would take multiple trips)
- Find a different crossing point (adds 2 hours to journey)

**Roleplay Opportunity:** Does Zurkt's Oath of Vengeance make them reckless? How do they handle being in a genuinely dangerous situation where their combat prowess doesn't help? Does their Thunder Goblin heritage make them more or less confident in dangerous situations?

---

### Challenge 3: The Haunting Presence (Charisma Save)

**Trigger:** As the party camps near some ancient ruins (potentially the outskirts of Conyberry).

**Description:** During Zurkt's watch, a spectral figure appears—translucent, flickering, clearly not of this world. It appears as a goblinoid warrior wearing ancient armour, bearing wounds that suggest they died in battle. The spirit speaks in Goblin: "You wear the oaths of righteousness, yet you are kin to me. You cannot escape what you are. The blood of raiders runs in your veins."

This ties directly into Zurkt's Haunted One background and their internal conflict between their goblin nature and their paladin oaths.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Charisma saving throw** to resist the spirit's attempt to shake Zurkt's conviction
- **Failure:** Zurkt is wracked with doubt about their worthiness. For the next 24 hours, they cannot use Channel Divinity (their conviction is shaken), and they have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with non-goblinoids. The effect ends early if Zurkt performs an act of obvious good that reinforces their oath.
- **Success:** Zurkt maintains their conviction. They can respond to the spirit, either arguing their case or accepting their heritage whilst asserting their choice to be different. The spirit fades, seemingly satisfied or at least unable to shake the paladin's resolve.

**Optional Divine Moment:** If Zurkt succeeds on the save and roleplays standing firm in their convictions, you could have their holy symbol briefly glow with divine light, affirming their oath. This doesn't provide a mechanical benefit but reinforces that their deity/oath recognises their struggle and commitment.

**Party Awareness:** The spirit appears only to Zurkt. Other party members see Zurkt apparently arguing with empty air, which could lead to interesting conversations afterwards.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** This is a deep character moment. How does Zurkt reconcile being a goblin with being a paladin? Do they confide in their companions afterwards? How does their Chaotic Good alignment factor into their response? Does this connect to their specific haunting from their background?

## Implementation Notes

### Pacing

- Spread these challenges across multiple days of travel
- Don't use all 12 challenges in one session—pick 6-8 total based on which locations the party chooses to visit
- Allow at least one challenge per day of travel, with some days having two

### Difficulty Balance

- These are designed to be challenging but not lethal
- Characters should feel tested without feeling punished
- Failed saves create interesting complications, not campaign-ending problems

### Party Dynamics

- These challenges encourage party members to support each other
- Characters can help each other (advantage on checks, taking actions to assist, etc.)
- Success isn't just about individual saves—it's about how the party works together

### Recovery

- Ensure the party has opportunities to rest and recover between challenges
- Some challenges can be avoided with clever thinking or good Navigation/Survival checks
- Don't roll for wilderness encounters on the same day a major saving throw challenge occurs

### Reward XP

After the session, consider awarding 50 XP per successfully handled challenge (whether the save succeeded or failed, but the party dealt with it well). This rewards good roleplay and problem-solving.

---

## Session Flow Example

**Day 1 - Departing Phandalin towards [Destination]**

- Morning: The Duke's Illusory Path (Intelligence) - Tests navigation

# Saving Throw Challenge - Testing the Party's Strongest Save

## Design Philosophy

This challenge tests **Dusty Crab's strongest saving throw** (Charisma +6) to provide a genuine test even of their greatest strengths. This encounter is designed to be difficult but fair, creating a memorable moment that shows even our most capable abilities can be pushed to their limits.

---

## Dusty Crab (Dragonborn Sorcerer)

**Saving Throw Profile:** STR +0, DEX +2, CON +3, INT +3, WIS +1, CHA +6 **Strength:** Charisma (Force of personality, magical presence, confidence)

### Challenge: The Banishment Circle (Charisma Save)

**Trigger:** The party discovers ancient ruins partially buried in the hillside—remnants of a pre-Spellplague site. As they investigate, Dusty Crab steps onto what appears to be a mosaic floor.

**Description:** The moment Dusty's foot touches the central tile, arcane runes flare to brilliant life around them in a perfect circle, 10 feet in diameter. The air crackles with planar energy—not lightning like Dusty's familiar magic, but something older and more fundamental. Ancient wards activate, designed centuries ago to banish extraplanar threats. The magic recognizes Dusty's draconic bloodline as "other" and begins the banishment ritual.

The runes pulse in sequence, building power with each rotation. Dusty feels their very essence being pulled, tugged toward somewhere else—a demiplane of imprisonment where threats to the Material Plane were once contained. Their body begins to flicker, becoming translucent at the edges.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 16 Charisma saving throw** (this is intentionally high to challenge Dusty's +6 bonus)
- **Timing:** Dusty must make this save immediately upon triggering the circle, then again at the start of each of their next two turns if they remain in the circle (total of up to 3 saves possible)

**Failure (1st Save):**

- Dusty becomes partially phased out of reality. They take 2d6 force damage as planar energy tears at their essence
- They are restrained (can't move, disadvantage on Dexterity saves, attacks against them have advantage)
- All magical effects on them are suppressed (including ongoing spell effects, but not inherent racial abilities)
- If they fail all 3 saves, they are banished to a demiplane for 1 minute (10 rounds) before the ancient magic fails and returns them

**Success (1st Save):**

- Dusty resists the initial pull through force of will and magical presence
- They take half damage (1d6 force damage)
- They can use their action to escape the circle (the magic continues but can't hold them)

**Subsequent Saves (if still in circle):**

- Each failed save: Additional 2d6 force damage and one step closer to banishment
- Each successful save: Dusty maintains their hold on reality but still takes 1d6 force damage from the strain

**Party Assistance:**

- Allies outside the circle can attempt to disrupt the magic:
    - **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check** to identify a way to deactivate the runes
    - **DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check** to physically pull Dusty from the circle (this breaks their concentration if they're resisting, forcing a new save with advantage)
    - **Dispel Magic** cast at the circle can suppress it for 1 round per spell level used
    - **Any forced movement ability** (like Xanorin's Thorn Whip) can pull Dusty out of the circle

**If Banished:**

- Dusty finds themselves in a grey, featureless void—a pocket dimension
- They can see their companions as ghostly, translucent figures but can't interact
- After 1 minute (or if allies successfully dispel the circle), the ancient magic exhausts itself and Dusty returns
- No permanent harm done, but it's a terrifying minute of isolation

**Tempestuous Magic Interaction:**

- If Dusty casts a spell whilst in the circle, they can use Tempestuous Magic to fly 10 feet as a bonus action, potentially escaping the circle's boundary
- However, casting whilst partially phased requires concentration and determination

**Critical Success (Natural 20):**

- Dusty not only resists the banishment but momentarily understands the ancient magic
- The runes permanently deactivate, and Dusty gains insight into planar magic (advantage on the next Arcana check related to planar travel or portals)
- They instinctively channel the dissipating energy through their draconic bloodline, regaining one expended 1st-level spell slot

**Critical Failure (Natural 1):**

- Immediate banishment, no additional saves
- Dusty is banished for the full minute
- When they return, they suffer one level of exhaustion from the planar trauma

---

## Tactical Considerations

**Why This Tests Dusty's Strength:**

- Despite their exceptional Charisma (+6), the DC 16 save means they need to roll 10+ to succeed (55% chance)
- This genuinely challenges even their best ability
- Multiple saves create tension—even if they succeed once, they must continue resisting or escape
- Their low Strength makes physical escape difficult, forcing them to rely on their magical prowess or teamwork

**Party Dynamics:**

- This encounter rewards party cooperation
- Xanorin's Thorn Whip (spell attack) can pull Dusty out
- The Duke's Athletics bonus (+4) gives them a decent chance to pull Dusty free
- Zurkt's lower intelligence makes the Arcana check difficult, but they could physically help The Duke pull Dusty out
- The party must act quickly—Dusty takes damage each round they remain in the circle

**Connection to Character:**

- Tests Dusty's force of personality and magical identity
- The ancient magic mistaking their draconic heritage for something "other" creates an interesting narrative moment
- Success reinforces Dusty's power and control; failure shows that even great power can be threatened by ancient wards
- Links to the world's history (pre-Spellplague defences)

---

## Roleplay Opportunities

**During the Challenge:**

- Does Dusty panic or remain focused?
- Do they call out instructions to their allies or try to handle it alone?
- How does it feel to have their very existence questioned by ancient magic?
- Does their Guild Artisan background help them understand crafted magical items?

**After the Challenge:**

- If banished: How does Dusty describe the experience of being pulled from reality?
- If they succeeded through their own power: How do they feel about proving their strength?
- If allies saved them: How does this affect their relationships and trust?
- Does this experience make Dusty more cautious about ancient magical sites?

---

## DM Notes

**Difficulty Assessment:**

- With Charisma +6, Dusty needs to roll 10+ on a d20 to succeed (55% success rate per save)
- This creates genuine tension without being unfairly punishing
- The escalating nature (multiple saves) keeps pressure on
- Party assistance options ensure this doesn't become a "save or die" situation

**Pacing:**

- This encounter should take 2-3 rounds of combat time (12-18 seconds in-game)
- Quick resolution maintains tension without dragging
- If Dusty is banished, use it as a dramatic moment but return them promptly

**Adjusting Difficulty:**

- **Easier:** Lower DC to 15 (Dusty needs 9+, 60% success)
- **Easier:** Reduce damage to 1d6 per failed save
- **Easier:** Require only 2 saves instead of 3
- **Harder:** Increase DC to 17 (Dusty needs 11+, 50% success)
- **Harder:** Banishment lasts 10 minutes instead of 1 minute

**XP Award:**

- Successfully escaping (whether through saves or party assistance): 100 XP
- This rewards problem-solving and teamwork rather than just rolling well

---

## Implementation Example

**Setup:** "As you crest the hill, partially buried ruins emerge from the earth—ancient stonework covered in creeping vines and moss. The architecture is unlike anything in Phandalin; these stones predate the Spellplague by centuries. Dusty, as you step forward to examine what looks like a mosaic floor, your foot touches the central tile and—"

**Activation:** "Brilliant blue-white runes explode into light around you in a perfect circle. The air itself seems to tear, and you feel a pulling sensation, like invisible hands trying to drag you... somewhere else. Your draconic bloodline screams danger. This magic sees you as _other_, as _threat_, as something to be banished. Roll a Charisma saving throw, DC 16."

**Failure:** "The ancient ward's power crashes over you like a wave. Your body flickers—you can see through your own hands for a moment—as planar energy tears at your essence. Take [roll damage] force damage. You feel frozen in place, unable to move as the runes pulse faster, building toward something. Your companions outside the circle watch in horror as you begin to fade from existence."

**Success:** "Through sheer force of will and your innate magical power, you push back against the banishment. Your draconic heritage roars in defiance—_you belong here, on this plane, in this reality_. The magic still claws at you [take half damage], but you've broken its initial grip. You can feel that if you can just get out of this circle..."

**Party Reaction:** "The rest of you see Dusty trapped in a ring of blazing runes, their form flickering and translucent. What do you do?"

This creates immediate tension and gives the party clear options to help whilst maintaining the pressure on Dusty to continue resisting.
