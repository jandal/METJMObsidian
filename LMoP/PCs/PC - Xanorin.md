## Background & Personality
### Personality Traits
I am quiet and observant, preferring to watch and listen before speaking or acting. I am slightly cautious and extremely loyal to those who earn my trust. My connection to nature gives me a deep sense of peace that others find calming.

### Ideals
Balance. The natural world teaches us that all things must exist in harmony. I seek to maintain that balance in all aspects of life.

### Bonds
I was taken in by a circle of druids after being orphaned. I owe my life to the forest and its guardians.

### Flaws
I can be overly secretive, a habit from my days as a spy that I find hard to break. I sometimes struggle to trust others with important information.

## Backstory
Xanorin grew up in a halfling community nestled at the edge of a vast forest. Orphaned at a young age, Xanorin was drawn to the mysteries of the woods and eventually caught the attention of a circle of druids who took the young halfling under their wing. They taught Xanorin the ways of nature and druidic magic.

As Xanorin matured, the druid circle occasionally called upon their small, nimble ally for special missions that required stealth and discretion. Over time, Xanorin developed skills as a spy, gathering information about threats to the natural world and the druid circle's interests. This dual life as both druid and spy has shaped Xanorin into a cautious, observant individual who values both the natural world and the delicate balance of information.

### Previous Quests
#### A Potent Brew
Xanorin and companions were hired by Glowkindle to clear out the cellar of the Wizard's Tower Brewery. The group successfully defeated 8 Giant Rats and a Giant Inferno Spider (Challenge Rating 1), earning 350 XP. The quest yielded 70 gold pieces, two Potions of Healing, one Potion of Invisibility, and goodwill with the local community.
