## Background Story
Aesome comes from a military family with a long tradition of service. Raised in the barracks and trained from a young age, he absorbed not just the techniques of warfare but also the philosophy of the warrior's path. He was drawn to the disciplined traditions of eastern warriors, eventually training in the ways of the samurai - a warrior tradition that resonated with his personal code of honour.

Having served in a mercenary company for several years, Aesome has now struck out on his own, seeking to prove his worth through noble deeds whilst maintaining the rigid discipline that defines him. His calm demeanour and unwavering loyalty have earned him the respect of those who fight alongside him.

- Starting wealth already spent on equipment above
- Plan to take Great Weapon Master feat at level 4 to synergise with Fighting Spirit advantage
- Level 6 ASI: +1 STR to reach 18 (then save remaining +1 for later or take +1 WIS)
- Human's +1 to all stats gives excellent all-around capability

- **Level 6:** ASI - +1 STR, +1 WIS (STR 17→18, WIS 13→14)
- **Level 8:** ASI - +2 STR (STR 18→20)
