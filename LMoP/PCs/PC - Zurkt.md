### Class Features
- **[[Class - Divine Sense]]**: As an action, detect celestials, fiends, or undead within 60 feet (uses: 4 per long rest = 1 + Charisma modifier of -1, minimum 1)
- **[[Lay on Hands]]**: Pool of healing power (15 points = paladin level × 5). Restore HP as an action (touch, 1 HP per point) or cure one disease/poison for 5 points. Recharges on long rest.
- **Fighting Style - Defence**: +1 AC whilst wearing armour

  - **Spell Save DC**: 9 (8 + proficiency bonus +2 + Charisma modifier -1)
  - **Spell Attack Modifier**: +1 (proficiency bonus +2 + Charisma modifier -1)
- **Divine Smite**: When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal extra radiant damage. The damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st (max 5d8). The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or fiend.
- **Divine Health**: Immune to disease
- **Sacred Oath**: Oath of Vengeance - sworn to punish those who commit evil acts

### Oath of Vengeance Features
#### Tenets of Vengeance
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil.

- **Fight the Greater Evil**: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
- **No Mercy for the Wicked**: Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
- **By Any Means Necessary**: My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.
- **Restitution**: If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

#### Channel Divinity (1 use per short or long rest)
You gain the following two Channel Divinity options:

**Abjure Enemy**: As an action, present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation. Choose one creature within 60 feet that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 9), unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.
- On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Whilst frightened, the creature's speed is 0 and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

**Vow of Enmity**: As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. You gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.

#### Prepared Spells
You can prepare 2 spells from the Paladin spell list after each long rest (Charisma modifier -1 + half Paladin level 1.5 = minimum 1, but you started with 2, so keep 2):
