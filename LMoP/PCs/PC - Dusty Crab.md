- **Careful Spell**: When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

## Background & Personality

### Personality Traits

I am a dragonborn sorcerer with innate magic from my Blue Dragon ancestry. The magic of lightning permeates my being. I am charismatic and persuasive, but can use intimidation to get what I want if needed. I focus on tasks at hand without being single-minded. I consult with my party but am comfortable making decisions independently.

### Ideals

Community. It is the duty of all civilised people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilisation. (Lawful)

### Bonds

The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me. I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy of it. I'm still looking for someone worthy.

### Flaws

I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more. No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.

## Backstory

Dusty Crab was born with an inherent connection to storms and lightning. As a blue dragonborn, electricity coursed through their veins naturally, manifesting in scales that occasionally crackle with energy when emotions run high. Their draconic heritage gives them both physical resilience and an innate connection to arcane power.

What makes Dusty Crab unique among draconic sorcerers is an additional attunement to air and weather. Not only can they channel lightning through their draconic bloodline, but they can also manipulate the very air around them—a rare combination of abilities that manifests as electricity that dances through swirling winds.

Seeking to understand and control these abilities, they joined a local artisan's guild that specialised in weather prediction instruments. There, they learned to craft devices that could detect pressure changes and predict storms, giving them a scientific understanding to complement their magical connection. During their apprenticeship, they discovered ancient texts in Primordial that revealed techniques for manipulating air currents, which they naturally picked up, becoming fluent in this elemental language.

As their powers grew, Dusty Crab realised they could be more than just a guild artisan. The ability to control both lightning and wind made them valuable on ships and trading caravans that needed protection from natural hazards. Now they seek adventure, using their unique connection to storm energy to forge their path in the world.
